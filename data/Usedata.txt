MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
Introduction
This methodology book describes MSCIs general Index calculation methodology for
the MSCI Equity Indexes
MSCI provides two ways of calculating MSCI Equity Indexes either by using the Price
Adjustment Factor PAF or the Index Divisors Index Divisors methodology available
as an appendix
These policies and guidelines affect all securities across the MSCI Equity Indexes
and products Unless otherwise stated the policies and guidelines apply therefore to
all securities in the MSCI Equity universe
Please note that the index construction methodology and other guiding principles for
MSCI Indexes can be found at wwwmscicom
MSCI Equity Indexes
The MSCI Equity Indexes measure the performance of a set of equity securities over
time The MSCI Equity Indexes are calculated using the Laspeyres concept of a
weighted arithmetic average together with the concept of chainlinking
MSCI country and regional equity Indexes are calculated in local currency as well as
in USD with price gross and net returns
Index levels are also available in several other currencies such as AUD BRL CAD
CHF CNY EUR GBP HKD INR JPY KRW RUB SGD CZK DKK IDR MXN MYR NOK
NZD SEK and TWD
While the local currency series of regional indexes cannot be replicated in the real
world it represents the theoretical performance of an index without any impact from
foreign exchange fluctuations  a continuously hedged portfolio
Indexes are calculated 5 days a week from Monday to Friday with the exception of a
selection of indexes that have Sunday calculations available
In certain cases where there are no qualifying securities it is possible for MSCI
Indexes to be empty following a security deletion or GICS change If an index
becomes empty it would be dynamically discontinued or ruptured It is then possible
for the index to be restarted once a new security qualifies for the index and this
index level would be rebased to an appropriate level at that time

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
For index maintenance purposes MSCI often uses data received from many different
sources Such data may need to be taken on specific and defined dates as relevant
to a specific index methodology Data Date In certain instances due to an
extraordinary event or exceptional technical issue data needed as of a Data Date
may not be available as expected from MSCIs data sources In such cases unless
specified otherwise in the relevant index methodology MSCI generally uses the latest
data available prior to the Data Date MSCI will release an announcement to inform
clients about the occurrence of these events
MSCI independently monitors the quality of data from its data sources on an ongoing
basis MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use data from alternative
sources if MSCI determines that the primary source data is not reflective of market
conditions In such circumstances and if deemed material MSCI will release an
announcement to inform clients about the change All such determinations are made
by the MSCI Equity Index Committee EIC If appropriate MSCI may conduct a
consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the most relevant
alternate source

1 MSCI Price Index Methodology
Price indexes measure the market prices performance for a selection of securities
They are calculated daily and for some of them on a real time basis Each index
captures the market capitalization weighted return of all constituents included in the
index
11 PRICE INDEX LEVEL
As a general principle todays index level is obtained by applying the change in the
market performance to the previous period index level

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
 From June 1 2007 to May 31 2008 to calculate the standard or small cap index
market capitalization except for FM countries and China A the security market cap
should be multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor
Additionally starting December 1 2015 to calculate the standard or small cap index
market capitalization except for China A the security market cap should be
multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor
From September 1 2009 to November 30 2009 to calculate the China A and related
indexes markets capitalization the China A securities market cap should be
multiplied by the Standard Index Inclusion Factor
The Standard Index Inclusion Factor is solely used for the computation of the MSCI
Standard Indexes and not for the Large Cap Mid Cap and Provisional Indexes as
these are all constructed using the Global Investable Market Indexes methodology
and were not subject to the transition methodology
The Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor is not used for the computation of the MSCI
Emerging Markets and AC Small Cap Indexes MSCI Small Cap Value and Growth
MSCI Provisional Small Cap and MSCI Small Cap Sectors Indexes as these are all
constructed using the Global Investable Market Indexes methodology and were not
subject to the transition methodology
Note
The only difference in the formulas between USD and local currency indexes
calculation is that the same exchange rate is used in the numerator and denominator
for local currency which means that there is no impact of currency change in the
performance Time variant exchange rates are used for the USD calculation

15 SECURITY INDEX OF PRICE IN LOCAL
The security Index of Price is distributed in MSCI daily and monthly security
products It represents the price return from period to period by utilizing the
concept of an index of performance with an arbitrary base value The index of price
is fully adjusted for capital changes and is expressed in local currency

16 NOTE ON INDEX CALCULATION IN LOCAL CURRENCY
The MSCI Country and Regional Indexes are calculated in local currency as well as
in USD The concept of a local currency calculation excludes the impact of
currency fluctuations
Note that for a country index the local currency index will not be the same as an
index calculated with the official currency of that country if there is more than one
currency of listing
All currencies of listing are considered in the index calculation in local currency
where current pricest and previous day pricest1 are converted into USD using the
same exchange rate exchange ratet1 in the numerator and denominator As a
consequence the FX factor drops out of the equation
The USD calculation includes exchange rates at t and t1 Therefore the local
currency calculation only represents the price appreciation or depreciation of the
securities whereas the USD calculation also accounts for the performance of the
currency or currencies relative to the USD
17 CONVERSION OF INDEXES INTO ANOTHER CURRENCY
An index can be calculated into any currency by converting the index in USD into
the selected currency using the formula below
If the base date of the index is prior to the start date of the currency the indexes
should be rebased and converted using the following formula

MARCH 2023
MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
  100 





Note that 100 in the formula is the base value This base value can be different
than 100 eg 1000 depending on the indexes
 If the base date of the index is equal or posterior to the start date of the currency the
indexes should be converted only using the following formula
   


Example
Calculation of the The World Index in EUR as of October 20 1999
Note that the start date of EUR is 31Dec1998

2 MSCI Daily Total Return DTR Index Methodology
Total return indexes measure the market performance including price performance
and income from regular cash distributions cash dividend payments or capital
repayments Regular cash distributions paid out of share capital or capital
contribution reserves are treated in the same manner as regular cash dividends
paid out of retained earnings This income is reinvested in the index and thus
makes up part of the total index performance
MSCIs Daily Total Return DTR methodology reinvests regular cash distributions
in indexes on the exdate of such distributions Regular cash distributions are not
considered in price indexes except for special dividends and capital repayments
deemed extraordinary in certain circumstances described below
The standard Daily Total Return DTR Indexes are calculated and distributed on a
daily basis The indexes are available in USD and local currency no currency
impact with gross and net total return

216 CURRENCY
For index calculations all dividends are converted into USD at the spot rate of the
ex date
217 NUMBER OF SHARES AND INDEX WEIGHTING FACTOR
A dividend amount is expressed per share entitled to the dividend Since the day
before the exdate is the last day on which the share is entitled to the dividend the
total dividend per security reinvested into an index is equal to the number of shares
at the close of the exdate1 multiplied by the dividend per share
In addition a weighting factor of a security in the index is applied to the total
dividend amount to be reinvested This can be the Domestic Inclusion Factor DIF
the Foreign Inclusion Factor FIF the Value Inclusion Factor VIF the Growth
Inclusion Factor GIF or any inclusion factor considered in the price index
calculation
22 REINVESTMENT METHODOLOGY
Gross Daily Total Return
This series approximates the maximum possible reinvestment of regular cash
distributions cash dividends or capital repayments The amount reinvested is the
cash distributed to individuals resident in the country of the company but does not
include tax credits
Net Daily Total Return
This series approximates the minimum possible reinvestment of regular cash
distributions Provided that the regular capital repayment is not subject to
withholding tax the reinvestment in the Net Daily Total Return is free of withholding
tax Effective December 1 2009 the regular cash dividend is reinvested after

deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of the companys
country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors MSCI uses different
withholding taxes depending if the indexes are international or domestic
 International indexes the maximum rate applicable to nonresident institutional
investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties
 Domestic indexes the maximum rate applicable to resident institutional
investors
For more information on how taxes are applicable to dividends please refer to the
Appendix for details about the withholding tax rates for the various countries
For Chinese securities with foreign listing which pay cash dividends in RMB MSCI
will use Offshore exchange rate CNH for reinvestment in the MSCI Daily Total
Return Indexes However historical correction of cash dividends reinvested prior to
April 1 2018 for such securities will continue to be reflected in CNY
For China A  Stock connect securities dividend reinvestment will use Offshore
exchange rate CNH
221 TIMING OF REINVESTMENT
The amount of an announced regular cash distribution is reinvested on the exdate
of such distribution on its principal exchange For securities trading on more than
one exchange MSCI uses the exdate at the exchange from which MSCI sources
the securitys price
If a security does not trade on the exdate or on the scheduled reinvestment date of
the regular cash distribution the reinvestment is postponed to the day when the
security resumes trading The scheduled reinvestment date of a dividend can be a
date later than the dividend exdate in cases including but not limited to a late
dividend or a dividend correction

There are two principal guidelines in regards to cash distributions reinvestments
 A cash distribution  in the form of regular cash dividend or regular capital
repayment  is reinvested among all the constituents in an index It is not
considered in the MSCI Price indexes Note that these distributions are taken
into account in the underlying securitys yield calculation
 A special cash dividend that is unusually large ie greater than or equal to 5
of the security cum price or a capital repayment deemed to be extraordinary
ie unlikely to recur on a regular basis is reinvested by applying a PAF and is
hence taken into account in MSCI Price indexes as well as in the MSCI DTR
Indexes
These guidelines are discussed in greater detail below
223 DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN A REINVESTMENT ONLY
The following cash distributions are reinvested in the MSCI DTR Index
Regular Cash Dividend
A regular cash dividend is a distribution of cash made by a company to its
shareholders and is paid out of operating profits or retained earnings Regular cash
dividends regardless of their size are reinvested on the exdate in the MSCI DTR
Indexes
Regular Capital Repayment
 2023 MSCI Inc All rights reserved Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document MSCICOM  PAGE 31 OF 146
MARCH 2023
MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
A capital repayment or return of capital is characterized by a cash distribution from
the companys share capital or capital surplus to its shareholders A capital
repayment regardless of its size is considered as regular if the cash distribution is
in lieu of a regular cash dividend or is in line with the dividend policy of the
company or with the historical cash distributions Provided that the capital
repayment is not subject to withholding tax the reinvestment in the MSCI DTR
Indexes is free of withholding tax
In Taiwan a cash distribution paid out of capital surplus is considered as regular
unless specified by the company that the distribution is deemed to be
extraordinary The cash distribution is reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes
Regarding the withholding tax treatment please refer to subsection 23721
below
Optional Dividend
In the case of an optional dividend the company offers shareholders the choice of
receiving the dividend either in cash or in shares However shareholders electing
the cash option may receive the dividend consideration in cash or shares or some
combination of cash and shares
MSCI assumes that shareholders receive the default distribution If no default
distribution is available MSCI assumes that shareholders elect the cash option
MSCI therefore reinvests the dividend amount on the exdate in the MSCI DTR
Indexes Please refer to the section 43 of the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology
book for more information regarding optional dividends treatment
Interest on Capital
The interest on capital dividend is a cash payment to shareholders accounted for
as a pretax interest expense by the company The balance sheet and the book
value do not change Interests on capital are common in Brazil
224 DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN A REINVESTMENT OR IN A PRICE ADJUSTMENT
The dividends below are reinvested in the MSCI DTR Index if the dividend impact
on the cum price is less than 5
However if the impact is greater than or equal to 5 the dividend will be reflected
in the MSCI Index through a price adjustment
SpecialExtraordinary Cash Dividend
The company declares the dividend as special or extraordinary It is funded by a
special event or from extraordinary profits MSCI may consider irregular and
 2023 MSCI Inc All rights reserved Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document MSCICOM  PAGE 32 OF 146
MARCH 2023
MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
unusually large dividends as special even if they are not declared as such by the
company
Special cash dividends that are smaller than 5 of the cum price of the underlying
security are reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes but are not included in the yield
calculation unless they are paid for at least three consecutive years
Special cash dividends that are greater than or equal to 5 of the market price of
the underlying security on the date the event is announced in confirmed status
are reinvested in the MSCI Indexes through an adjustment on the exdate A PAF
using the gross dividend amount is applied to the MSCI Price Indexes the MSCI
Gross DTR Indexes and the MSCI Net DTR Indexes on the exdate of the special
cash dividend Note that MSCI will not cancel the PAF implementation if the size of
the special dividend becomes smaller than 5 after it has been announced in
confirmed status
For special cash dividends that are greater than or equal to 5 of the market price
and subject to a withholding tax as defined in Section 2372 MSCI reinvests a
negative amount corresponding to the withholding tax in the MSCI Net DTR
Indexes only This negative reinvestment is reflected simultaneously with the PAF
on the exdate of the special cash dividend
Any special cash dividend distributed for at least three consecutive years is taken
into account in the yield calculation of the underlying security regardless of its
size
Commemorative Dividend memorial
A company declares a dividend as commemorativememorial The funds come
from extraordinary profit or cash generated by a special event
RetroactiveArrears Dividend
Retroactive dividends are paid in Italy when a company has to pay a dividend to
revenueguaranteed RISP shares to make up for previous years nonpayments
Special Dividend to NonDomestic Shareholders
A company pays its nondomestic shareholders a bonus dividend to compensate
for the tax credit distributed to domestic shareholders This is a common practice
in New Zealand
225 DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN A PRICE ADJUSTMENT ONLY
A PAF is applied to the security in the MSCI Price Indexes the MSCI Gross DTR
Indexes and the MSCI Net DTR Indexes in the following cases

Stock Dividend stock bonusgratis issue
The company issues shares at no direct cost to the shareholders The funds are
taken out from the current years earnings In the case of a stock bonusgratis
issue the company distributes a part of the reserves retained earnings from
previous years to its shareholders
For Taiwanese and Indian stock dividends subject to withholding and capital gains
tax respectively MSCI reinvests a negative amount corresponding to the tax
amount in the MSCI Net DTR Indexes only This negative reinvestment is reflected
simultaneously with the PAF on the exdate of the stock dividend
Extraordinary Capital Repayment
Capital repayments that are deemed to be extraordinary compared to the dividend
policy of the company or to the historical cash distributions are reinvested in the
MSCI Indexes through an adjustment A PAF using the gross capital repayment
amount regardless of its size is applied to the securitys market price on the exdate
Dividend Paid in Shares of another Company
The company distributes stock of another company as a dividend The number of
shares held remains the same but the price will decrease by the value of the
distributed security
MSCI considers other cash payments related to Corporate Events such as
mergers acquisitions liquidations etc on a casebycase basis
23 PROCESSING RULES
231 DIVIDEND DATA
Raw dividend data is provided by multiple electronic data feeds and is checked for
completeness and correctness MSCIs Daily Total Return process requires that
dividends be confirmed by at least two distinct data sources Most dividends are
received and validated through electronic feeds but some dividends may require
confirmation from other sources such as stock exchanges or the company In
addition MSCI monitors securities for which a dividend is expected based on
previous dividend announcement frequency but which has not yet been received
through the regular data sources

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
232 CORPORATE ACTIONS
A corporate action which changes the number of shares outstanding for a
company may take place between the dividends announcement date and its exdate As the number of shares on the day preceding the exdate is used to
calculate the dividend amount to be reinvested MSCI adjusts the dividend to
reflect the number of shares on that day
Following certain corporate events the number of shares used in MSCI Index
calculations on the cum date may include shares that are not issued yet or that are
not entitled to the dividend In those cases MSCI reinvests the dividend on the exdate as if all shares included in MSCI Index calculations were entitled to the
dividend
233 LATE DIVIDENDS
A late dividend is a dividend that is only known after its exdate It is processed
under the correction policy as described in subsection 234 above
234 CORRECTIONS
A dividend that has been reinvested may need to be amended due to an error in its
exdate in the dividend amount or in the dividend currency MSCI will give advance
notification for dividend corrections that are received after their exdate
Consequently the correction in the index will be postponed to the next business
day following the reception and announcement of the information
The following rules apply
 Action is taken only if the error is discovered within 12 months of the ex date
 In the case of a correction MSCI uses the number of shares at the close of the
cum date The spot rate of the reinvestment date is used for currency
conversion
 A historical correction is applied to all indexes impacted by more than 50 basis
points1
if the impact on a country or World  EM industry group index is over 50
basis points Starting December 1 2010 for the MSCI Frontier Markets Indexes
including MSCI GCC Countries Indexes there will be a historical correction
only if the impact on the MSCI Frontier Markets region is over 50 basis points
1 The 50 basis point limit is linked to the price index correction policy and will be revised accordingly to reflect
any changes in this policy

MARCH 2023
MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
 The security that needs a dividend correction may have changed its status for
index inclusion between the exdate and the correction date For example this
may be due to the securitys subsequent exclusion from the index or a change in its
industry or country classification Applying the correction with the current status may
reinvest dividends into the wrong index If there is a change in the securitys index
inclusion status between the exdate and the correction date no correction amount
will be reinvested
235 PAYMENT DEFAULT
A correction is applied when a dividend is declared unpaid payment default This
may result in a negative reinvestment Past index levels are not corrected
The following rules apply
 Action is taken only if the payment default is discovered within 12 months of
the exdate and is in line with the price index correction policy where MSCI
applies a 12 month correction period
 MSCI uses the number of shares effective at the close of the original cum date
The default amount is reinvested on the next business day following the
reception and confirmation of at least two distinct data sources  The spot rate
of the reinvestment date is used for currency conversion
236 COUNTRY EXCEPTIONS
Japan
Many Japanese companies declare their dividends after the exdate As estimated
dividends are available before the exdate and are broadly used an estimation of
the dividend is reinvested on the exdate When a company does not declare an
estimated dividend MSCI uses the previous years dividend amount from the same
period as the estimation Should the difference between the estimated and ratified
dividend amount warrant correction it will be processed as a payment default
reinvestment without correcting past index levels on the next business day
following the reception date from the data sources
Korea
Many Korean companies declare their dividends after their exdate As no
estimated dividends provided by the companies are available before the exdate
the dividends are reinvested on the next business day following the reception and
confirmation of at least two distinct data sources in accordance with the section

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
These reinvestments after the exdate do not trigger any correction of the index
levels
MSCI uses the number of shares effective on the day prior to the exdate to
reinvest the dividend
In the rare case of Korean companies declaring their dividends prior to their exdate MSCI reinvests dividends into the MSCI DTR Indexes on the day the security
is quoted exdividend on its principal exchange in accordance with the section
221
Should the dividend amount for Korean companies change following approval by
the shareholders at the general meeting MSCI will reinvest the difference between
the amount initially announced by the company and the final amount approved by
the shareholders This does not trigger any correction of past index levels
Starting December 2014 for dividends with an ex date from December 2014
onwards MSCI will transition to the enhanced methodology for Korean dividends
as per the following
Under the enhanced methodology MSCI will reinvest an estimated dividend
amount for Korean securities on the exdate of the dividend
The estimate will be calculated as the previous years dividend amount from the
same period adjusted by any capital changes if necessary If no dividend was paid
from the same period in the previous year or an estimated dividend amount is not
available MSCI will reinvest the dividend amount of zero
Once a Korean company announces the actual dividend amount MSCI will reinvest
on the next business day following reception of data from MSCIs sources all
differences between the estimated and ratified dividend amount if any in the MSCI
DTR Indexes without correcting index levels
These estimates will be used for the calculation of the dividend yield as if the
amounts were not estimates
Singapore
Some companies in Singapore for example Real Estate Investment Trusts REITs
pay advanced cash distributions at the time of placement of new shares in order
to ensure fairness to the existing shareholders This distribution is a part of the
regular quarterly cash dividends announced by the companies If an estimated
amount or range of dividend amount is declared by the company before the exdate MSCI reinvests the estimated amount or lower range of the dividend amount

in MSCI DTR Indexes on the day the security is quoted exdividend on its principal
exchange in accordance with the section 221
Should the dividend amount change after the exdate following company
announcement MSCI will reinvest the difference between the amount initially
announced by the company and the final amount on the next business day
following the reception and confirmation of at least two distinct data sources
These reinvestments after the exdate do not trigger any correction of past index
levels
USA Redemption Right
When a company redeems shares distributed to shareholders due to a poison pill
rights issue applies mainly in USA there may be a change in the companys
capital structure In this case MSCI will apply a price adjustment
237 TAXES ON DIVIDENDS
Shareholders may be taxed on dividend payments Tax rates vary depending on
the companys and shareholders country of domicile Tax data is monitored on a
regular basis and is updated when necessary
2371 TAX CREDIT
A tax credit related to a dividend can be considered as a reimbursement of tax
already received by the fiscal administration In countries operating under an
imputation tax system a companys annual earnings are taxed before distribution
to the shareholders and then the shareholders pay taxes on the dividend Some
countries operating under an imputation tax system provide shareholders with a
tax credit to offset the amount of the tax they would otherwise owe in respect of
the dividend2 MSCI does not take into account the amount of a tax credit in
calculating either gross or net dividends
2372 WITHHOLDING TAX
A withholding tax related to a dividend is a tax on the income of the shareholder
withheld by the company when the dividend is paid to a shareholder The
withholding tax rate depends on the tax status of the shareholder MSCI uses the
maximum withholding tax rate applicable to institutional investors in calculating
2 Singapore and Malaysia completely migrated to a onetier tax system from imputation system effective
January 1 2008 and January 1 2014 respectively Under a onetier or singletier tax system a company pays
a tax on its taxable income and shareholders are not charged with a tax on dividends paid to them by the
company

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
MSCI net dividends A nonresident shareholder must also pay taxes on dividends
in hisher domestic country as part of hisher income taxes Countries may
eliminate this double taxation by signing bilateral double taxation treaties
MSCI uses companies country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend
withholding tax rates in calculating the net dividends and the MSCI Net DTR
Indexes In cases where the withholding tax rate in the companys country of
incorporation is higher than the MSCI companys country of classification as
determined in accordance to Appendix III of the MSCI Global Investable Markets
Indexes Methodology MSCI will make a specific analysis to determine the actual
withholding tax rate applied to nonresident institutional investors
Companies country of incorporations are reviewed on a semiannual basis and
changes to companies withholding tax rates if any are made with the May and
November Index Reviews
In the calculation of the MSCI Net DTR International Indexes MSCI uses the
withholding tax rate applicable to nonresident institutional investors that do not
benefit from double taxation treaties
In the calculation of the MSCI Net DTR Domestic Indexes MSCI uses the
withholding tax rate applicable to domestic institutional investors
Provided that the regular capital repayment is not subject to withholding tax the
reinvestment in the MSCI Net DTR is free of withholding tax
NOTE MSCI applies a weighted average withholding tax rate to the total cash
amount distributed by a company when
 a portion of the cash dividend amount is subject to a different withholding
tax rate Refer to the Appendix 6 for more details on withholding tax
applicable to dividends paid by REITs
 two or more cash distributions paid by the same company are ex on the
same day but subject to different withholding tax rates
23721 COUNTRY EXCEPTIONS
Australian Dividends
Some Australian companies pay their dividends with franking credits attached in
order to pass on to investors the value of any tax that the company has already
paid on its profits Dividends can be fully franked partially franked or unfranked
Foreign nonresident investors are subject to the Australian dividend withholding
tax on the unfranked portion of a dividend However foreign nonresident investors
are not subject to the Australian dividend withholding tax on the unfranked portion

of the dividend to the extent that it is declared as conduit foreign income3 by
Australian companies or on the franked portion of the dividend
In the calculation of the MSCI Net DTR International Indexes for Australian
dividends MSCI uses the withholding tax rate4 applicable to foreign nonresident
institutional investors on the unfranked portion of the dividend that is not
designated as conduit foreign income MSCI does not apply withholding tax rate on
the franked portion of the dividend or the unfranked portion of the dividend
declared to be conduit foreign income
In the case that the franking percentage andor the conduit foreign income not
publicly available prior to the exdate the franking percentage andor the conduit
foreign income will be assumed zero correspondingly
The effective withholding tax rate being applied to the Australian dividends in the
MSCI Net DTR International Indexes is as follows
Effective withholding tax rate  Australia default withholding tax rate x 100 
franking   conduit foreign income

Net Daily Total Return DTR Indexes only The negative amount per share will be
calculated as follows
Negative amount per share  Closing price of the security on the exdate  Shares
Issued  15  Shares before
The negative reinvestment is reflected simultaneously with the PAF on the exdate
of the stock dividend
Taiwanese Stock Dividends
In Taiwan stock dividends can be paid out from capital surplus or retained
earnings The portion of stock dividends paid out of retained earnings is subject to
the default withholding tax rate against the par value of each new share The
portion of stock dividends paid out of capital surplus is not subject to a withholding
tax
To take into account this withholding tax in the MSCI Indexes MSCI reinvests a
negative amount corresponding to the withholding tax in the MSCI Net DTR
Indexes only
This negative amount of the withholding tax is calculated using the following
formula
Withholding tax of Taiwanese stock dividend  Number of shares received which
are subject to the withholding tax x par value of each share x Taiwanese default
withholding tax rate5

This negative reinvestment is reflected simultaneously with the PAF on the exdate
of the stock dividend
Taiwanese Capital Repayments
In Taiwan the cash distributions paid out from the types of capital surplus which
are originally contributed by shareholders are not subject to any withholding tax
Otherwise the cash distributions paid out from the types of capital surplus not
originally contributed by shareholders are subject to a withholding tax The cash
distribution paying out of the capital surplus originally contributed by shareholders
is therefore reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes free of withholding tax Otherwise
the cash distribution paying out from the equity capital not originally contributed by
shareholders is reinvested with the default withholding tax rate In the case that a
Taiwanese company does not clarify the source of capital surplus the cash
distribution is reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes free of withholding tax

Thailand Cash Dividends
In Thailand the Board of Investment BOI provides tax exemptions to certain
companies that generate profit from promoting investment activity in Thailand
These companies can be classified as BOI promoted companies and are referred
to as operating under BOI privilege When a company under BOI privilege
distributes dividends the dividends derived from business profit generated by BOI
related business can be exempted from withholding tax However NonVoting
Depositary Receipt NVDR holders are not entitled to the withholding tax
exemption
MSCI does not take into account such tax exemption in calculating net dividends
That is MSCI does not differentiate dividends derived from business profit under
BOI privilege and nonBOI privilege MSCI will therefore reinvest the full cash
dividend amount with the default withholding tax rate in the MSCI DTR Indexes

Appendix I Sunday Intermediary Index Calculation
for MondayFriday Index Calculation Methodology
Calculation Methodology
A selected list of MSCI Indexes is calculated on Sunday to reflect the performance
of the markets open on this day
In order to preserve compatibility with the other MSCI Indexes which are calculated
from Monday to Friday MSCI uses the concept of a Monday preopening
intermediate calculation for the Sunday calculation The Sunday index
performances capture the price changes and reflect corporate events effective on
this day
In case of corporate events occurring on Sundays and where a Price Adjustment
Factor PAF is needed the PAF is applied to the market price of the security on
Sunday and Monday If the security does not trade on Monday the Sunday closing
market price is carried forward to Monday including the PAF
Changes in the securitys number of shares FIFs andor DIFs due to corporate
events occurring on Sunday are implemented as of the close of Monday
regardless of whether the corporate event requires the application of a PAF on
Sunday or not
The index constituent list is the same as the one to be used for the Monday
calculation
WMRefinitiv spot FX rates as of the previous Friday is carried forward to the
Sunday in order to perform the index calculation in USD
No dividends are reinvested on Sundays Consequently the Daily Total Return
DTR index performances for Sunday will be equal to the ones of the price index
The chainlinking for these indexes can be summarized as follows
 Sundays daily index performance is computed by comparing Sundays
adjusted prices and the previous Fridays unadjusted prices
 Mondays daily index performance is computed as currently by comparing
Mondays adjusted prices and the previous Fridays unadjusted prices

Appendix III Exchange Rates
Closing Spot Rates
Until December 30 1993 MSCI used the exchange rates taken from the Reuters
multi contributor pages at 400PM CET
Since December 31st 1993 MSCI has been using the WMRefinitiv Closing Spot
Rates taken at 4PM London time for all the countries for which it provides indexes
except for the Latin American countries At the time MSCI established a special
foreign exchange policy for Latin American countries in view of the risks of
important movement of currencies in some of these markets between the 4PM
London closing and the close of the respective Latin American markets
Starting July 26 2000 MSCI began to use the WMRefinitiv Closing Spot Rates
taken at 4PM London time for all the countries it provides indexes including Latin
American countries
In case WMRefinitiv does not provide spot rates for specific markets on given
days for example Christmas Day and New Year Day the previous business days
rates are used
MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes MSCI may
under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange
rates if MSCI determines that the WMRefinitiv rates are not reflective of market
circumstances for a given currency on a particular day for example divergence
between onshore and offshore rates In such circumstances an announcement
would be sent to clients with the related information All such determinations are
made by the MSCI Equity Index Committee EIC If appropriate MSCI may
conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the
most relevant exchange rate
Forward Rates
MSCI uses the spot and 1month premiumdiscount as provided by WMRefinitiv to
compute the 1month Forward exchange rates These values are taken at 4PM
London time
If a Forward rate is missing the previous business days Forward
premiumdiscount will be added to the current business days Spot rate if
available else the previous business days Spot rate will be used
In cases where WMRefinitiv does not provide forward rates for specific markets
on a given day for example Christmas Day and New Year Day the previous
business days rates are used

Appendix IV Singapore  Malaysia  A History of
Inclusion in the Emerging and Developed Markets
Indexes
Stock Markets
Stock trading has a long history in Singapore dating back to the 1930s In 1960
the Malayan Stock Exchange started trading shares publicly There were trading
floors in both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur linked as a single market When
Singapore split from Malaysia the stock exchange continued to operate as one
under the name Stock Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore SEMS In 1973 the
accord that allowed for the convertibility at par between the Singapore Dollar and
Malaysian Ringgit was terminated This led to the separation of SEMS into the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange KLSE and the Stock Exchange of Singapore SES
Malaysian companies continued to trade heavily in Singapore
MSCI Indexes
On December 1st 1972 the MSCI SingaporeMalaysia Index was added to the
World Index The index was developed in cooperation with the OverseasChinese
Banking Corporation which published the same index under the name OCBC
Index As is the case with other MSCI Indexes the purpose was to track those
securities representative of Singapore However as approximately half the market
capitalization and liquidity of the SES was due to Malaysian shares the index was
designed to incorporate both Singaporean companies as well as those Malaysian
shares that traded in Singapore This aspect was different from other MSCI
Indexes as the norm is to only include domestically listed shares In light of the
long integrated history of the Malay Peninsula and Singapore and the continued
dual listing of shares it was deemed to be more representative to include these
Malaysian companies as representative of the opportunity set of the SES
MSCI launched its emerging market series on January 1 1988 Among other
country indexes was an index of Malaysia with 59 securities As MSCI was now
covering emerging markets the MSCI Mexico Index was pulled out of MSCI World
The World Index was to be considered a developed market index
In 1989 the Malaysian government announced that Malaysian companies would be
asked to delist their shares from the SES Previously the government had
prohibited newly listed shares of Malaysian companies from listing on the SES In

November 1989 reacting to the Malaysian government announcement MSCI
initially announced its intention to remove Malaysian securities from the
SingaporeMalaysia index The following month MSCI announced that the terms
and timing of the Malaysian delisting were too ambiguous As a result MSCI would
take a wait and see approach prior to removing any Malaysian securities from the
SingaporeMalaysia index As a result the Malaysian shares in the MSCI
SingaporeMalaysia Index were effectively frozen or grandfathered Over time
some of these shares were no longer listed on Singapore but continued to be
included in the index using the Ringgit price at which they were traded in Kuala
Lumpur
In January 1992 MSCI announced a change The SingaporeMalaysia index was
now composed of a representative sampling of Singaporean companies coupled
with grandfathered Malaysian securities that used to trade in Singapore but were
no longer trading there as a result of the delisting requirement Malaysia was
clearly an emerging market for example its GDP per capita was 2340
considerably below that of Spain 10920 the lowest country that was currently in
the MSCI World Index Nonetheless many developed market investors had
historically purchased Malaysian companies as a result of some Malaysian
companies being included in the MSCI World and EAFE Indexes Deleting all
Malaysian companies from the developed market indexes could have been very
disruptive to the markets As a result of this dilemma MSCI decided to add
Malaysia as a country to the World and related developed market indexes while
continuing to include Malaysia in the emerging market series One could not have
a credible emerging market series without the continued inclusion of Malaysia in
that series
Thus Malaysia was to be represented in both the developed and emerging market
series At the time MSCI acknowledged that the existence of Malaysia in both the
developed and emerging market series was less than ideal As of April 30th 1993
Malaysia was fully added to the developed market series resulting in the addition
of approximately 40 securities This was because the MSCI Malaysia Index was
designed to represent the profile of the entire Malaysian market whereas the
current Malaysian stocks in the World and EAFE Indexes were selected to reflect
the composition of those Malaysian stocks trading in Singapore ACWI clients
would not have to worry about double counting as Malaysia was represented at its
appropriate market cap weight The index of Singapore represented the
continuation of the SingaporeMalaysia index and therefore retains its base date of
December 31 1969 Developed and emerging market indexes excluding Malaysia
were calculated for those clients who preferred a different classification

The Asian Crisis
The Asian Crisis starting in 1997 with the devaluation of the Thai Baht eventually
spread to Malaysia On September 1st 1998 Malaysia imposed a series of
restrictions on the convertibility of the Ringgit These controls effectively
prohibited the repatriation of funds On Sept 4th 1998 MSCI announced that
effective Sept 30th Malaysia would be removed from the EAFE and World Indexes
and that its status in EMF was under review In the MSCI announcement of the
change it was stated the limitations in repatriating investment proceeds would
seriously challenge the objective and integrity of the MSCI Developed Markets
Indexes were the Malaysian securities to remain in these indexes These
restrictions imposed by the government of Malaysia thus ended the legacy issue of
Malaysian securities appearing in both the developed and emerging market series
On Sept 28th 1998 MSCI announced that Malaysia would be removed from the
MSCI EMF and ACWI Free series as of the close of November 30th 1998 As part
of the capital controls imposed foreign investors became obligated to hold
Malaysian securities for a period of oneyear commencing Sept 1st 1998 before
any possible capital repatriation The authorities also imposed a fixed exchange
rate of 38 Ringgit to the US dollar The measures taken by the government along
with the lack of transparency meant that Malaysias inclusion in the Free series of
indexes was no longer justified A discount of 30 was applied to the valuation of
the MSCI Malaysia Index in US dollars effective Sept 30th 1998 The discount was
applied because market forces no longer determined the official exchange rate
On February 5th 1999 MSCI announced that effective February 26th 1999 the
discount would be reduced to 15 This followed the Malaysian Government
announcement on the previous day that it was alleviating the restrictions on the
repatriation of investments
As a result of the removal of the restrictions on the repatriation of capital MSCI
announced on August 12 1999 the removal of the 15 discount effective August
30 1999 On November 23 1999 MSCI announced that Malaysia would be reincluded fully at 100 in the EMF and AC Free indexes as of May 31 2000
MSCI Malaysia Indexes will be removed from the MSCI Emerging Markets Free
EMF series and the MSCI All Country AC Free Indexes effective as of the close
of 30th November 1998 Of course Malaysia was not readmitted to the developed
market series as its inclusion there was a result of the previously explained
anomaly

What is the difference between the MSCI Singapore Index and the MSCI
Singapore Free Index the MSCI EAFE Index and the MSCI EAFE Free Index the
MSCI World Index and the MSCI World Free Index
In the 1990s Singapore enacted a system to prevent companies in strategic
industries mainly banks airlines and the media from being controlled by
foreigners Certain shares had limits on the percent that could be purchased by
foreigners Once the limit was reached these shares traded at a premium price
The MSCI Singapore Free Index used the prices at which foreigners could trade
MSCI also started calculating the regional indexes MSCI World Free Index MSCI
EAFE Free Index and MSCI Pacific Free Index to include the MSCI Singapore Free
Index as well as to reflect investment restrictions in some of the Nordic countries
and Switzerland The MSCI Singapore Index nonfree version reflected the
investment opportunities applicable to domestic investors
In May of 1999 the foreign ownership restrictions in Singapore were lifted and as
of that date the MSCI Singapore Index and MSCI Singapore Free Index and the
corresponding regional developed market Free and nonFree indexes have had the
same constituent market caps and performance Only the absolute index levels
continue to differ MSCI will continue both the Free and NonFree versions of MSCI
Singapore Index MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI World Index to reflect the differing
history

Appendix IX MSCI Real Time Indexes
MSCI currently calculates price net and gross variants for approximately 9000
equity based indexes in real time as well as the FX Hedge Currency ShortLeveraged
and Daily Hedged indexes All MSCI Real Time Indexes are calculated based on the
corresponding endofday index calculation methodologies
MSCI disseminates real time indexes every 60 seconds or 15 seconds depending on
the index type and its use in the marketplace On a daily basis for each real time
index MSCI will provide an Index Open value IO which will occur when the first
security belonging to that index trades an Index Update value IU which will occur
throughout the day after the Index Open has been sent and an Index Close value IC
which will be sent out as the last real time level and indicate the real time closing
value6
Real Time Intraday Foreign Exchange Rates vs Real Time Close Foreign Exchange
Rates
MSCI Real Time Indexes use the Reuters Multi Contributor FX Rates for all Index
Open and Index Updates and MSCI applies the WM 4PM London time Closing Mid
Rates for the Index Close
Monocurrency indexes which are indexes that have exposure to a single currency
will have their Index Close value sent shortly after the underlying stock exchanges
close and do not require the WM 4PM London closing rate to calculate the Index
Close
Multicurrency indexes which have exposure to multiple currencies require the WM
4PM London closing rate to calculate the Index Close Multicurrency indexes whose
underlying stock exchanges close before the WM 4PM London rates are received will
have their last Index Update sent shortly after the last underlying stock exchange
closes and then will have their Index Close sent when the WM 4PM London Close is
received Multicurrency indexes whose underlying stock exchanges close after the
WM 4PM London rates are received will continue to use the Reuters Multi Contributor
6 The real time Index Close could be different from the index value for the same index delivered in MSCIs end
ofday product files due to due to postmarket close data updates implemented including but not limited to
updates for security prices FX rates and interest rates during the endofday calculation process The official
closing level of any MSCI index is the level distributed in MSCIs endofday product files

Index Open and Index Update calculations use the last traded price available and the
Index Close uses the official closing price or last trade as described in the MSCI

Input Security Price FX Rate Interest Rate and Output calculated Index Level
Data filtering criteria
MSCI has various filtering criteria set in place to minimize irregularities in MSCIs
Real Time index levels calculations
MSCIs security price market filters exclude trades such as block sales and odd lots
among others These types of trades are preexcluded by default and not considered
in the calculation of the MSCI Indexes as they may not reflect the prevailing market
prices at the time of calculation
MSCIs security price FX rate and interest rate threshold filters ensure that
fluctuations above or below a certain threshold for these input data are checked prior
to being included in the calculation of the MSCI Real Time Indexes A similar logic is
applied to any variations outside preset thresholds for the MSCI Real Time Index
levels
Whenever an input data point is filtered the relevant data point will be held and not
used in MSCIs Real Time index levels calculations Instead the last known input data
point before the filtered value will be used until the filter is either accepted or
rejected based on investigations or the input data point falls back within the
predefined threshold for inclusion or exclusion in the calculation of the MSCI Real
Time index levels For filtered output the last known MSCI Real Time Index level will
be displayed until the filtered Index level is either accepted or rejected based on
investigations or when the index level falls back within the predefined threshold
Thresholds for the abovementioned filters may vary depending on external factors
like market conditions for both input data and calculated Index levels
Real Time Cash Dividend Reinvestment
Consistent with the Daily Total Return DTR endofday index calculation
methodology MSCIs real time DTR calculation will reinvest a dividend only if the

security paying the dividend trades on the exdate The dividend will be reflected in
real time index calculations as soon as the security paying the dividend trades in real
time If the security does not trade on the exdate or on the scheduled reinvestment
date the dividend reinvestment will be postponed to the day when the security
resumes trading Late dividends or corrections will be treated in real time
calculations consistent with the endofday DTR index calculation methodology For
more details on MSCIs DTR methodology please refer to the Section 2
General Announcement Policy for Dividends
Upcoming dividends to be reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes are announced prior
to their reinvestment in the MSCI Security Advanced Dividend File
Late dividends and dividend corrections that are received after their exdate are
reinvested or corrected in the MSCI DTR Indexes on the next business day following
the reception date from the data sources Therefore there is at least one days notice
through the MSCI Security Advanced Dividend File prior to their reinvestment and  or
correction
In exceptional cases MSCI will announce the treatment of dividends that are not preannounced in the MSCI Security Advanced Dividend File and are received by MSCI
during market hours on their exdate through an intraday option email
announcement
Price Adjustment Factor PAF Announcements
MSCI sends a Closing PAF announcement for all Real Time constituents that have a
corporate event effective involving the calculation of a theocum PAF such as a
special cash dividend capital repayment or when a shareholder receives something
other than the underlying asset
The closing PAF announcement uses the closing price of the security having the
corporate event and is used in the Index Close calculation The closing PAF value is
sent shortly after the closing price of the security having the corporate event is
received For more information on corporate events please see the MSCI Corporate
Event Methodology document

Special Quotation SQ
The MSCI Special Quotation SQ is a MSCI Index level that is calculated using
Opening Prices for the Index constituents Opening Prices are used collectively in a
single index calculation regardless of the time of day the Opening Price became
available
The SQ calculation occurs within the first 30 minutes after the relevant market is
opened for trading
In case a security that did not trade within the first 30 minutes after the relevant
market is opened eventually trades MSCI will reissue the SQ calculation using the
updated Opening Price
In case of market closure or if a security does not trade on the specific settlement
day MSCI carries the latest available closing price for the security or market in the
SQ calculation
Constituents and weights are identical to the standard MSCI index upon which the
SQ calculation is based
The SQ calculations are made on a custom calendar basis typically on the third
Friday of a calendar quarter
Intraday or Midday Calculations
An Intraday or Midday Index level is calculated using security prices and Multi
Contributor FX Rates extracted from MSCIs Real Time system as of predefined time
of day on each calculation date Security prices may include a mixture of official
close prices according to MSCIs Closing Prices Policy found in Appendix VII of this
document and Real Time last sale prices as of the calculation time FX Rates are not
official benchmarks set by any organization or agency Security prices and FX Rates
are subject to the filtering criteria mentioned above to ensure data quality and may
not reflect the prevailing market prices at the time of the calculation Security prices
and FX Rates used in the Intraday or Midday Index level are not used for next day
constituent weights or for any rebalancing algorithm that the relevant Index
Methodology may employ
If interest rates are used based on relevant index methodology input data filtering
criteria detailed before are also applied

Snapshots from Real Time
A Snapshot Index level is a specific tick from MSCIs Real Time calculation feed as of
hhmm on the calculation date MSCIs Real Time index calculations are performed
either every 15 seconds or every 60 seconds and are load balanced so that the
Snapshot Index level may come from any one of 60 seconds within the target

Appendix X Index Calculation Methodology Using
Index Divisors
INTRODUCTION
An index level is calculated by multiplying the weighted average performance of the
index constituents by the previous index level This section presents an alternative
way of calculating an index level which is similar to the traditional way of valuing a
portfolio by simply multiplying asset constituent quantities by current prices and
adding up the results The index divisor concept introduced below is central to this
alternative index calculation
When calculating a securitys performance on days with certain corporate events a
price adjustment factor PAF is needed to ensure historical price comparability This
factor often accounts for assets that contribute to the index performance for a day
such as rights offerings spunoff companies or cash In the alternative index
calculation methodology described herein the PAF is replaced by the interim
constituents which explicitly capture the impact of corporate events
DEFINITIONS
Index Divisor t
The index divisor for a day t is defined as the ratio of the initial market capitalization
and the previous index level
 

1
The index divisor does not change unless the index composition changes eg in
cases of corporate events and index additions  deletions where a change in index
market capitalization is not due to performance and does not correspond to a
change in the index level
The index divisor for day t is known after the close of day t1 the initial index market
capitalization is calculated using prices and exchange rates as of day t1 but
constituents as of t
The index divisor can be calculated in any currency both the index initial market
capitalization and the previous index level need to be expressed in that currency

Index Unit
The index unit describes the set of index constituents and corresponding quantities
of total value equal to the index level It can be derived by dividing the total index
quantities by the index divisor
Intraday Index Number of Shares t
The intraday index number of shares is the number of shares of a security taken into
account for the index calculation and valid both intraday and at the close of day t
before any changes due to corporate events or index reviews Note that it is
adjusted by the various index inclusion factors such as the Foreign Inclusion Factor
FIF7
 for day t Also note that it can be different from the number of shares used for
the index calculation described in Section 11 which is an end of day number of
shares in cases of corporate events
Intraday Index Unit Number of Shares t
The intraday index unit number of shares is the intraday index number of shares
expressed for one index unit It is defined as the ratio of the intraday index number of
shares and the index divisor
 


End of Day Index Number of Shares t
The end of day index number of shares is the number of shares of a security taken
into account for the index calculation for the next day t1 but expressed on a pre
t1 events basis for example if a company has a stock split on t1 the end of day
index number of shares for day t will be on a presplit basis This number of shares
however takes into account changes due to corporate events effective as of the
close of t and is adjusted by the various index inclusion factors such as the Foreign
Inclusion Factor FIF for day t1 Note that it is based on the same number of shares
as the one used for the index calculation on t1 EndOfDayIndexNumberOfSharest
and described in Section 11
7
Index inclusion factors encompass any inclusion factors specific to a given index for example the Value
Inclusion Factor VIF for a Value index

End of Day Index Unit Number of Shares t
The end of day index unit number of shares is the end of day index number of shares
expressed for one index unit It is defined as the ratio of the end of day index number
of shares and the index divisor for t1

The index unit composition changes from the intraday index unit number of shares to
the end of day index unit number of shares as of the close of day t ie the index unit
number of shares change is calculated as
 
  
Index Dividend Points
Index dividend points express dividends paid in an index unit for a given day They
represent dividends as a fraction of the index level itself To provide advance notice
MSCI calculates both the preliminary index dividend points on t1 for t that use
exchange rates as of t1 and the final index dividend points on t using t exchange
rates and capturing the effect of the intraday dividend changes on t if any
Both gross and net index dividend points can be calculated for a price index variant
they express the amount of dividends paid by a price index unit
Net gross index dividend points can be calculated for a net gross index variant
they express the amount of dividends reinvested in the net gross index unit

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
Dividend points can be aggregated at index level
  
  
Preopen Price
The preopen price of a security on day t is its closing price of day t1 theoretically
adjusted for the effects of corporate events affecting the security ex on day t
CALCULATING THE INDEX
Index Calculation Formula
The index unit value serves to calculate the index level The equation below is valid
both intraday and as of the close
    

where Priceit is replaced by the preopen price for the constituents that have not yet
traded on t and I is the index unit constituent set The previous index level can also
be recalculated by using preopen prices and exchange rates of the previous day
1    1

Index Calculation Example
Consider the MSCI Austria index unit on October 27 2009 described below Its
composition is fully known after the close of October 26 2009 and is described by
the constituent list and the intraday index unit number of shares column F
calculated as the ratio of the intraday index number of shares and the index divisor
To calculate the index level on October 27 2009 intraday or close current prices
and exchange rates columns I and J respectively are used for each constituent and
the market capitalization of the constituent in the index unit column K is obtained
by multiplying the intraday index unit NOS by the prices and dividing by the exchange
rate The sum of the column K gives the value of the index unit which is equal to the
index level

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
CALCULATING INDEX UNIT CHANGES DUE TO CORPORATE EVENTS AND
INDEX REBALANCINGS
As corporate events and rebalancings occur the index unit composition can change
All adjustments are based on closing prices To get the index unit adjustment the
new index divisor needs to be calculated Dividing the end of day index number of
shares by the new index divisor results in the end of day index unit number of shares
Given the equations

coming from the divisor definition and
 


coming from the divisor definition and the
fact the index level is proportional to the index market capitalization on any given
day a practical way of calculating the new divisor is

be added to the index Hence the index divisor and the index unit composition will
change as of the close of October 21 2009
A new index divisor for October 22 2009 is calculated by multiplying the current
divisor for October 21 2009 by the sum of the next day constituents initial market
capitalizations column M and dividing by the current index market capitalization
sum of column L The new end of day index unit number of shares column N is
calculated by dividing the end of day index number of shares column H by the new
divisor The index unit composition is adjusted by the difference between the end of
day index unit number of shares and intraday index unit number of shares column
O in this case 016 shares of BC SANTANDER BRASIL UNIT are added to the index
unit by decreasing the index unit number of shares of all the other index constituents
INTERIM CONSTITUENTS8
On days with certain corporate events the index can hold constituents that influence
the performance for a day When calculating the index performance using price
adjustment factors as described in section 11 these do not appear explicitly in the
calculation formula but are accounted for implicitly by applying a price adjustment
factor PAF on the capitalization of the security affected by the corporate event The
index however is exposed to all the constituents and when valuing an index unit
these need to be explicitly taken into account For example the following corporate
events result in a creation of interim constituents

Interim constituents were added to the product files in the second phase of the MSCI Market Open Index

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
Capital Repayments the index calculation assumes that cash is received in the index
and held until the close when it is finally reinvested in the index so cash effectively
brings performance to the index on the exdate and is part of the index unit
Spinoff with the spunoff company not eligible for the index the calculation
assumes that the spunoff company is received in the index on the exdate and is
held until the close when it is finally sold and the proceeds reinvested back in the
index In this case the spunoff company is effectively part of the index on the exdate
Note that the interim constituents play a similar role in the index calculation as the
price adjustment factor PAF and the resulting index levels are exactly the same
whether using interim constituents or PAFs
To explain how interim constituents are created several examples of common
corporate events are described below Some corporate events can result in the
creation of more than one interim constituent but these can also be broken up in
several simple consecutive corporate events
Examples
Capital Repayment
As an example consider the repayment of EUR 04 per share by ELISA A effective
October 26 2009 According to the calculation methodology this cash is reinvested
back in the index as of the close of the ex date October 26 2009 Hence intraday
the MSCI Finland index unit holds both ELISA A and the cash An interim constituent
is therefore added to the index unit as shown below with the following
characteristics
Intraday index unit number of shares equal to the stock that repaid capital given that
each share of ELISA A in the index unit is entitled to the cash payment
Fixed price equals to the repayment amount EUR 040
Cash will leave the index unit as of the close of October 26 as indicated by column
G and the proceeds reinvested back in the index Repeating the calculations
described in the previous section gives the index unit number of shares change
column O that represents the theoretical trade adjustment to the index unit cash is
sold negative change while the index unit holdings in all the other constituents
increase positive change

Spinoff with the Spunoff Company Traded on the Ex date
As an example consider the spinoff of GAM HOLDING by JULIUS BAER HOLDING
with 11 terms effective October 1 2009 for the MSCI Switzerland Large Cap index
displayed below The spunoff company is not eligible to stay in the index
On the ex date October 1 2009 the spunoff company still brings performance to
the index and is hence part of the index unit It is therefore part of the index with the
following characteristics
Intraday index unit number of shares calculated according to the terms intraday
index unit number of shares of the parent stock  11
Market price given that the spunoff company is traded on the exdate
It is sold from the MSCI Switzerland Large Cap index unit at the close of the exdate
and the proceeds are reinvested back in the index To determine the index unit
number of shares column O the calculations described in the previous section
should be repeated

Spinoff with Spunoff Not Traded on the Ex date
As an example consider the spinoff of SONAE CAPITAL by SONAE SGPS effective
January 4 2008 Given that the spunoff company is not trading on the exdate but
the market capitalization of the parent stock drops nevertheless to account for the
value of the spunoff company MSCI creates a dummy security called detached
to represent it Its price is calculated as the difference between the cum and ex
prices of the parent security on the exdate from the exdate  1 onwards It will be
carried in the index at this calculated fixed price until the day it starts trading where it
is either added to the index or deleted at the end of the first trading day On the exdate however it is represented by an interim constituent with the following
characteristics
Intraday index unit number of shares equal to the parent company terms are not
considered as this is a dummy security
Calculated price in real time equal to the difference between the cum price closing
price of the previous day of the parent company and the ex current price
At the close of the exdate the interim constituent is replaced by the detached
security Note that there is no divisor change and hence no index unit number of
shares change

Rights Issue
As an example consider the rights issue for BALFOUR BEATTY effective October 8
2009 in the MSCI UK Index9 and described below 3 rights were offered for every 7
shares held at 18 GBP
The performance of the index on the exdate reflects an exposure to the rights and
the BALFOUR BEATTY weight increases only as of the close of the exdate Note that
the adjustment for a rights issue is always theoretical the intrinsic value of the right
is the difference between the underlying stock price and the subscription price even
if the rights will list on an exchange An interim constituent with the following
characteristics is created
Intraday index unit number of shares calculated according to the terms intraday
index unit number of shares of BALFOUR BEATTY times 37
A calculated price defined as the price of BALFOUR BEATTY minus the subscription
price of 18
At the end of the day the interim constituent is deleted from the index the rights are
subscribed to and the exposure to BALFOUR BEATTY increases its intraday index
number of shares and the divisor increase The index unit adjustment column O is
given by the calculations described in the previous sections
9 Note that this example is based on the current adjustment methodology for rights issue The methodology
being different before November 2009 the published index level was calculated in a different way in practice

INDEX METHODOLOGY
Appendix XI Index Correction Policy
If the impact of an error is below 50 basis points on the country index OR on the
WorldEM Industry Group or 50 basis points on the MSCI Frontier Markets region
including the MSCI GCC Countries no index re statement is made
If the impact of the error is greater or equal to 50 basis points on the country index
OR on the WorldEM Industry Group or 50 basis points on the MSCI Frontier Markets
region including the MSCI GCC Countries all of the indexes affected by 50 basis
points or more are re stated
In certain circumstances such as errors in the list of constituents ie a security
missed or if MSCI finds that the error is significant enough to justify the revision of
indexes impacted by less than 50 basis point eg 13 of US prices wrong MSCI
reserves the right to correct information even if the impact is lower than the 50 basis
points correction threshold
MSCI applies a 12 months correction period Errors on historical values older than 12
months are in general not revised

MSCI INDEX CALCULATION METHODOLOGY  MARCH 2023
Appendix XII SundayThursday Index Calculation
Methodology
Calculation Methodology
MSCI also provides a different series of indexes that are calculated from Sunday to
Thursday and which reflect the performances of markets that follow a Sunday to
Thursday trading calendar These Indexes are not calculated on Friday or Saturday
The Sunday index performances capture the price changes and reflect corporate
events effective on this day In case of corporate events occurring on Sundays and
where a Price Adjustment Factor PAF is needed the PAF is applied to the market
price of the security on Sunday
Changes in the securitys number of shares FIFs andor DIFs Additionsdeletions to
and from Index due to corporate events are implemented as of the close of Sunday
regardless of whether the corporate event requires the application of a PAF or not
The index constituent list is calculated from Sunday to Thursday
MSCI carries forward the WMRefinitiv spot FX rates as of the previous Friday for the
index calculation on Sunday
Dividends are reinvested on Sundays Consequently the Daily Total Return DTR
index performances for Sunday will be calculated by comparing DTR Index levels of
the previous Thursday
The chainlinking for these indexes can be summarized as follows
 Sundays daily index performance is computed by comparing Sundays adjusted
prices and the previous Thursdays unadjusted prices
 Mondays daily index performance is computed by comparing Mondays adjusted
prices and the Previous Sundays unadjusted prices

Calculation
MSCI indexes undergo index reviews with a scheduled frequency and pro forma
index information is announced in advance of the effective date of the review The
schedule of index reviews and the number of days for advance notification are as
mentioned in the corresponding index methodology books To enable such an
advance notification the index reviews are conducted in advance of the effective
date based on pro forma index information consistent with the advance notification
requirement This advance notification does not exist in the calculation of index
history and in other situations when simulated index data is used where all indexes
are calculated based on index data as of the effective date

Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 18
FloatAdjusted Market Capitalization
Companies will be eligible for inclusion in Nifty 50 index provided the average freefloat market
capitalisation is at least 15 times the average freefloat market capitalization of the smallest
constituent in the index
Limit on total number of changes
As part of the semiannual reconstitution of the index a maximum of 10 of the number of
companies in the index ie five companies may be added in a calendar year
Where the committee considers that the number of changes at the first semiannual rebalance
might restrain the second semiannual rebalance it retains the right to reduce the number of
constituent changes at the first review in reverse order of the freefloat capitalisation In other
words the largest eligible company will be added and the smallest company removed and then
the next largest added and next smallest removed and so on until the committee deems that
the appropriate number of changes have been made
At the second semiannual rebalance the same principle applies however once a total of five
companies have been added to the index across the two semiannual reviews no further
additions or deletions will be made
However the limit of maximum 10 change shall not be applicable for any exclusion of a
company due to it not meeting the eligibility criteria on account of factors such as nonavailability
of FO higher impact cost lower trading frequency scheme of arrangements such as merger
demerger delisting specific cases of capital restructuring etc shifting to BZ series trading
suspension adverse regulatory findings or orders issued against any of the index constituent as

 A comprehensive list of basic industries eligible to be included in this index can be
accessed in a separate section in this document Click Here
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 47
Stock Selection criteria
Selection of the stocks shall be done in following steps
Step 1 Select all the eligible stocks from Nifty 100
Step 2 If the cumulative coverage based on 6 month Average FFMCAP of the stocks selected in the
step 1 is less than 75 within their basic industries across the combined universe then the stocks
from Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 50 are sorted in the descending order of the 6 month
Average Freefloat mcap within each basic industry
Step 3 The stocks are then selected from the sorted universe until the 75 coverage by cumulative
weight including the stocks selected in step 1 of 6 month Average FFMCAP of the eligible stocks
within the basic industry is reached
Weights and capping
 Weights of each stock in the index will be calculated based on its freefloat market
capitalization
 The following manufacturing sectors shall have a minimum weight of 20 each
1 Automobile and Auto Components
2 Capital Goods
 The maximum weight of each stock within the index is capped at 5
 The weight of the stocks shall be rebalanced on a semiannual basis along with the
Nifty Broadbased indices
In case the number of stocks within the Automobile or Industrial Manufacturing sector falls below 4 the
constraint of minimum sector weight will be relaxed for that sector
Reconstitution
 Index reconstitution and rebalancing will be done along with the Nifty Broadbased
indices on a semiannual basis in March and September and made effective on the last
trading day of March and September using the 6 month Average freefloat capitalization
ended January and July respectively
 Stocks forming partgoing to be part of the eligible basic industries within the combined
universe of Nifty 100 Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 50 at the time of review are
eligible to be the part of the index
 The following guidelines are used in order to achieve the target sector coverage of 75
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 48
 Step 1 Select all the eligible stocks from Nifty 100
 Step 2 If the cumulative coverage based on 6 month Average FFMCAP of the
stocks selected in the step 1 is less than 75 within their basic industries within
the combined universe the stocks from Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 50
are sorted in the descending order of the 6 month Average Freefloat mcap within
their basic industries
 Based on the above sorting the cumulative  freefloat basic industry coverage is
calculated
 In each basic industry where the cumulative  freefloat coverage after the
selection of stocks within Nifty 100 is less than 75 the companies are selected
until the cumulative basic industry coverage of the selected companies crosses
75 following the below guidelines
 The company that increases the cumulative basic industry coverage above
75 is termed as marginal company
 If the marginal company is an existing index constituent it is retained in
the index
 If the marginal company is a new constituent it will be included in the
index
 Only if the cumulative weight of companies before the addition of
marginal company is less than 70
 If the cumulative weight exceeds 75 after the addition of the
marginal stock such that the excess weight above 75 is lower than
the earlier deficit below 75 ie 75 minus the cumulative weight
before including the marginal stock For instance if the cumulative
weight of the stocks before the addition of marginal stock is 725
and on the addition of the marginal stock the cumulative weight
becomes 77 the stock will be included in the index as the excess
weight of 2 is lower than the deficit of 25 But if on the addition
of marginal stock the weight becomes 78 the new constituent will
not be included in the index as the excess weight of 3 is higher than
the deficit of 25
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 49
 If there is only 1 eligible stock within the basic industry it is included
in the index
 If adding a nonmarginal existing index constituents ranked immediately after the
marginal stock does not increase the basic industry coverage beyond 80 such
existing stocks would be retained in the index
 Apart from the scheduled semiannual review additional adhoc reconstitution and
rebalancing of the index shall be initiated in case any of the index constituents
undergoes suspension or delisting or scheme of arrangement
 Further on a quarterly basis indices will be screened for compliance with the
portfolio concentration norms for ETFs Index Funds announced by SEBI on January
10 2019 In case of noncompliance suitable corrective measures will be taken to
ensure compliance with the norms

Stock selection criteria
As on the base date of the index select the largest 30 stocks subject to availability from the
Eligible Universe based on their average daily free float market capitalization based on previous
six months period data
Weight and Constituent Capping
 Stock weights are determined based on their free float market capitalizations
 Stock weights of index constituents are capped at 20 each on a quarterly basis in March
June September and December
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 51
 For capping purpose the weight of the DVR and its parent stock would be derived in the
following way
o Aggregate the Free Float Market Capitalization of the DVR security and its parent
o The weight of the combined entity will be split into the weight of the parent security and
the DVR security in the proportion of the Free Float Market Capitalization of the parent
and DVR
 The weight of the sectors and stocks may drift between two rebalancing periods due to the
movement in stock prices
Reconstitution  Rebalancing criteria
 Index reconstitution will be done on a semiannual basis in March and September along with
the Nifty Broadbased indices based on data for 6 months ending January and July
respectively
 In case the number of stocks in the eligible universe exceeds 30 companies will be included
if freefloat market capitalisation is at least 15 times the freefloat market capitalization of
the smallest index constituent in respective index
 From April 2016 onwards equity securities with Differential Voting Rights DVR are eligible
for inclusion in the index subject to fulfilment of specified DVR related criteria mentioned
below
o Market capitalisation criteria is measured at a company level by aggregating the
market capitalisation of individual class of security meeting the liquidity criteria
for the respective index
o Free float of DVR equity class share should be at least 10 of freefloat market
capitalization of the company voting equity class share and DVR equity class
share and 100 freefloat market capitalization of last security in respective
index
o It should meet liquidity criteria applicable for the respective index
o Upon inclusion of DVRs in index the index may not have fixed number of
securities For example if DVR of an existing Nifty 50 constituent is included in
Nifty 50 the Nifty index will have 51 securities but continue to have 50 companies
o It is possible that the DVR is eligible for inclusion in the index whereas the full
voting rights security class is ineligible In such scenario the DVRs shall be included
in the index irrespective of whether full voting rights share class is part of index

Shariah Screening Process
Business Screening
Activities which are not permitted under Shariah are those which involve engaging in interest
earning businesses or in those businesses which are mostly harmful to human society and
disallowed by Shariah Thus companies engaged in promoting promiscuity violence vulgarity
and businesses affecting the environment are also considered Shariah noncompliant Hence all
companies which are primarily into the following activities are screened out on the business
parameter
 Conventional financial services such as banks insurance companies finance and investment
companies stock broking etc
 Production sale and marketing of food  beverages such as Pork Alcohol Tobacco and such
other items etc
 Companies involved in production or distribution of vulgar entertainment such as film and
other recreational activities where vulgarity promiscuity is a part and parcel of the business
undertaken  promoted
 Hotels and restaurants providing products or entertainment not permitted under Shariah
 Gambling Narcotic drugs etc
Financial Screening
Since interestbased transactions are prohibited by Shariah companies passing the business
screening stage are further screened to ensure that their dealings involving interestbased debt
or earnings out of  deployment of funds on interest are within the maximum tolerance limits
set by Shariah scholars There are certain variations in these tolerance limits based on place and
time To remain on the conservative side from a Shariah adherence perspective TASIS has
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 59
adopted financial screening norms which are more conservative than those followed by its peers
and also justified by empirical studies of the Indian environment TASIS norms are given below
 Interest baseddebt should be less than or equal to 25 of Total Assets
 Interest income plus returns currently considered 75 from interestbased
investments should be less than or equal to 3 of the total income
 Receivables plus cash and bank balances should be less than or equal to 90 of Total
Assets
Income Purification Ratio IPR
For full compliance with Shariah law investors are required to purge the pro rata portion of
interest income accrued on their holding of shares in a company

base composition
 Shariah compliance screening is done on monthly basis and review of Nifty Shariah 25 index
is undertaken semiannually based on data for six months ending January and July
 During monthly review if any index constituent becomes nonShariah compliant then
Shariah compliant nonindex constituent from replacement pool will be included in the index

with 15 times free float market capitalization is available in replacement pool than the last
index constituent by free float market capitalization
 If any index constituent is replaced due to corporate action such as demerger etc then such
company becomes eligible for index if it fulfils Shariah compliance norms for 12 months
Constituent Capping
Weights of each stock in Nifty50 Shariah and Nifty500 Shariah indices are calculated based on its
freefloat market capitalization such that no single stock shall be more than 33 and weights of
top 3 stocks cumulatively shall not be more than 62 at the time of rebalancing
Each constituent in the Nifty Shariah 25 index is capped at 10 This means that at the time of
rebalancing of the index no single constituent shall have weightage of more than 10 The
capping factor of stocks is realigned upon replacement of scrips in the index and on a quarterly
basis and made effective from the last trading day of March June September and December
In the event of weight realignment capping factors will be calculated for all constituents whose
uncapped weight is greater than maximum capping limit Weightage of such constituent may
increase beyond maximum capping limit between the rebalancing periods depending on the

2Nifty Dynamic Asset Allocation indices
Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PE
Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PB
Introduction
The Nifty Dynamic Asset Allocation Index series includes hybrid indices that track multiple assetclasses namely equity and debt The dynamic asset allocation model assigns weights between
the two asset classes based on relative market valuation The index series presently consists of 2
indices namely Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PE Index and Nifty 50  Short Duration
Debt  Dynamic PB Index
Within Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PE and Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt 
Dynamic PB indices asset allocation between equity and debt is done by a model that uses
PriceEarnings ratio PE or PriceBook ratio PB of Nifty 50 index While the allocation is
primarily between equity and debt in case the model prescribes allocation to equity that is lower
than 65 the equity arbitrage is used to maintain the equity allocation at 65 Arbitrage is done
by giving equal allocation to Nifty 50 TR index and Nifty 50 Futures index short In case arbitrage
is used 10 of the asset allocated to Nifty 50 Futures index short is additionally allocated to
Nifty 1D Rate index CBLO component in order to capture the margin requirement
Highlights
 The Indices have a base date of April 01 2005 and base value of 1000
 Asset allocation is based on a model that compares current PriceEarnings ratio PE or PriceBook ratio PB with the average maximum and minimum PriceEarnings ratio PE or PriceBook ratio PB of Nifty 50 in previous 7 years
 Maximum allocation to equity component is 80 and minimum allocation is 65 including
arbitrage
 Maximum allocation to debt including CBLO component is 35 and minimum allocation is
20
 In case arbitrage is used 10 of the asset allocated to Nifty 50 Futures index short is
allocated to Nifty 1D Rate index CBLO
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 90
 The asset allocation in the index is rebalanced on a monthly basis
 Weights of the equity fixed income CBLO and arbitrage component can drift between
monthly reset dates due to underlying asset price movement
Methodology
 The Nifty Dynamic Asset Allocation Indices present consist of 2 indices namely
o Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PE Index where asset allocation
is based on the comparison of Nifty 50 PE with the average maximum minimum PE
of Nifty 50 in previous 7 years
o Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PB Index where asset allocation
is based on the comparison of Nifty 50 PB with the average maximum minimum PB
of Nifty 50 in previous 7 years
 For both indices the assets are allocated among following components
o Equity component  Nifty 50 TR Index
o Debt component  Nifty Short duration debt index
o Arbitrage Component  Nifty 50 TR Index and Nifty 50 Futures index short
o CBLO Component  Nifty 1D Rate Index
 Exhibit 1 Allocation between equity and debt components depending on comparative ratio
Asset Allocation rules
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 91
In case of Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt  Dynamic PE and Nifty 50  Short Duration Debt 
Dynamic PB indices
 Equity allocation Nifty 50 TR is determined by an asset allocation model which compares
the current value of PE or PB of Nifty 50 with the average maximum and minimum PE or
PB of Nifty 50 in previous 7 years
 Maximum allocation to equity component is 80 and minimum allocation is 65
 In case the model prescribes an allocation to equity that is lower than 65 the equity
arbitrage is used to maintain the equity allocation at 65 Arbitrage is done by giving equal
allocation to Nifty 50 TR index and Nifty 50 Futures index short
 In case arbitrage is used 10 of the asset allocated to Nifty 50 Futures index short is
additionally allocated to Nifty 1D Rate index CBLO component in order to capture the
margin requirement
 Remaining allocation is given to debt component Nifty Short duration debt index hence
maximum allocation to debt including CBLO component is 35 and minimum allocation is
20
 The asset allocation in the index is rebalanced on a monthly basis
 The month over month change in allocation to equity component Nifty 50 TR excluding
arbitrage component by asset allocation model at the time of rebalancing is capped at 10

Z score of factors considered for the index are calculated based on the weighted average Z score
of underlying parameters which is discussed below
1 Quality Factor
 Quality score is calculated on the basis of return on equity ROE debttoequity DE ratio
and EPS growth variability in the previous 5 years DE is not considered for companies
belonging to financial services sector
 Companies with negative EPS in the previous 6 years are excluded
 To derive ZScore for nonfinancial service company equal weightage is given to ROE DE
and EPS growth variability in the previous 5 years For Financial Service sector company
50 weightage is given to ROE  EPS growth variability
 Average weighted Z score is calculated for all securities as per the following formula
Quality Z score Non Financial service sector  13  Z score of ROE  13  Z score of DE  13  Z
score of EPS growth variability
Quality Z score Financial service sector  5  Z score of ROE  5  Z score of EPS growth variability
2 Value Factor
 Value Z score are calculated on the basis of ROCE Return on Capital Employed PE PB and
Dividend yield DY
 Average weighted Z score is calculated for all securities as per the following formula
Value Z score 03  Z score of PE  02  Z score of PB  04  Z Score of ROCE
 01 Z score of Div Yield
 In case quality is also one of the factors in the index then average weighted Z score is
calculated for all securities as per the following formula
Value Z score 03  Z score of PE  03  Z score of PB  02  Z Score of ROCE
 2 Z score of Div Yield
3 Low Volatility Factor
 Low Volatility Z score is calculated using the inverse of Std deviation based on previous 1
year prices returns

 In order to reduce the number of rebalancing of constituents in a review a buffer of
50 of total number of the constituents shall be applied at the time of each review This
means that if the existing constituent at the time of the review ranks within the top 30
the same can be retained in the index However if a stock ranks within the top 5 stocks

index no single constituent shall have weightage of more than 15 The capping factor of stocks
is realigned upon replacement of scrips in the index and on a quarterly basis from the last trading
day of March June September and December
In the event of weight realignment capping factors will be calculated for all constituents whose
uncapped weight is greater than 15 Weightage of such constituent may increase beyond 15
between the rebalancing periods depending on the price movement The capping factor is
calculated considering the closing prices of the index constituents 3 trading days T3 prior to
the effective date T day of the changes

Differential Voting Rights
Equity securities with Differential Voting Rights DVR are eligible for inclusion in the index
subject to fulfilment of specified DVR related criteria given below
 Market capitalisation criteria is measured at a company level by aggregating the market
capitalisation of individual class of security meeting the liquidity criteria for the respective
index
 Free float of DVR equity class share should be at least 10 of freefloat market
capitalization of the company voting equity class share and DVR equity class share and
100 freefloat market capitalization of last security in respective index
 It should meet liquidity criteria applicable for the respective index
 Upon inclusion of DVRs in index the index may not have fixed number of securities For
example if DVR of an existing Nifty 50 constituent is included in Nifty 50 the Nifty index
will have 51 securities but continue to have 50 companies
 It is possible that the DVR is eligible for inclusion in the index whereas the full voting rights
security class is ineligible In such scenario the DVRs shall be included in the index
irrespective of whether full voting rights share class is part of index

trading and which is not held by the entities having strategic interest in a company Higher IWF
suggest greater number of shares held by the investors as reported under public category within
a shareholding pattern reported by each company
The IWFs for each company in the index are determined based on the public shareholding of the
companies as disclosed in the shareholding pattern submitted to the stock exchanges on
quarterly basis The following categories are excluded from the free float factor computation
where identifiable separately

Impact Cost
Liquidity of a security can be measured through factors such as trading frequency traded
turnover volume of shares to total shares issued ratio of turnover to market capitalization
impact cost etc Generally securities with higher of each of the above factors excluding impact
cost suggest superior liquidity on a relative basis
Impact cost in simple words is a cost that an investor is required to incur for executing his buy or
sell order as against the ideal cost of that security Company with lower impact cost suggest the
high liquidity as against the company with higher impact cost For selection of securities in
indices such as Nifty and Nifty Junior liquidity is screened on the basis of impact cost as criteria
Liquidity in the context of stock markets means a market where large orders can be executed
without incurring a high transaction cost The transaction cost referred here is not the fixed costs
typically incurred like brokerage transaction charges depository charges etc but is the cost
attributable to lack of market liquidity as explained subsequently Liquidity comes from the
buyers and sellers in the market who are constantly on the lookout for buying and selling
opportunities Lack of liquidity translates into a high cost for buyers and sellers
When a buyer or seller approaches the market with an intention to buy a particular stock he can
execute his buy order in the stock against such sell orders which are already lying in the order
book and vice versa
An example of an order book for a stock at a point in time is detailed below
Buy Sell
SrNo Quantity Price Quantity Price Sr No
1 1000 350 2000 400 5
2 1000 340 1000 405 6
3 2000 340 500 420 7
4 1000 330 100 425 8
There are four buy and four sell orders lying in the order book The difference between the best
buy and the best sell orders in this case 050 is the bidask spread If a person places an order
to buy 100 shares it would be matched against the best available sell order at 4 ie he would
buy 100 shares for 4 If he places a sell order for 100 shares it would be matched against the
best available buy order at 350 ie the shares would be sold at 35
Hence if a person buys 100 shares and sells them immediately he is poorer by the bidask spread
This spread may be regarded as the transaction cost which the market charges for the privilege
of trading for a transaction size of 100 shares
Progressing further it may be observed that the bidask spread as specified above is valid for an
order size of 100 shares upto 1000 shares However for a larger order size the transaction cost
would be quite different from the bidask spread
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 188
Suppose a person wants to buy and then sell 3000 shares The sell order will hit the following
buy orders
Sr No Quantity Price
1 1000 350
2 1000 340
3 1000 340
while the buy order will hit the following sell orders
Quantity Price Sr No
2000 400 5
1000 405 6
This implies an increased transaction cost for an order size of 3000 shares in comparison to the
impact cost for order for 100 shares The bidask spread therefore conveys transaction cost for
a small trade
This brings us to the concept of impact cost We start by defining the ideal price as the average
of the best bid and offer price in the above example it is 3542 ie 375 In an infinitely liquid
market it would be possible to execute large transactions on both buy and sell at prices which
are very close to the ideal price of 375 In reality more than 375 per share may be paid
while buying and less than 375 per share may be received while selling Such percentage
degradation that is experienced visvis the ideal price when shares are bought or sold is called
impact cost Impact cost varies with transaction size
For example in the above order book a sell order for 4000 shares will be executed as follows
Sr No Quantity Price Value
1 1000 350 3500
2 1000 340 3400
3 2000 340 6800
Total value 13700
Weighted average price 343
The sale price for 4000 shares is 343 which is 853 worse than the ideal price of 375
Hence we say The impact cost faced in buying 4000 shares is 853
Definition Impact cost represents the cost of executing a transaction in a given stock for a
specific predefined order size at any given point of time
Impact cost is a practical and realistic measure of market liquidity it is closer to the true cost of
execution faced by a trader in comparison to the bidask spread
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 189
It should however be emphasised that
 impact cost is separately computed for buy and sell
 impact cost may vary for different transaction sizes
 impact cost is dynamic and depends on the outstanding orders
 where a stock is not sufficiently liquid a penal impact cost is applied
In mathematical terms it is the percentage markup observed while buying  selling the desired
quantity of a stock with reference to its ideal price best buy  best sell  2

Corporate Actions and Share Updates
Maintenance of Nifty indices includes carrying out adjustments for corporate actions like stock
splits stock dividends share changes and scheme of arrangements Some corporate actions
such as bonus stock splits and reverse stock splits require simple changes in the equity shares
outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the index
Other corporate actions such as change in equity rights issue of shares special dividend change
in investible weight factor IWF  free float results into change in the market value of an index
overall and require a divisor adjustment to prevent the value of the index from changing
This helps in keeping the value of the index accurate and ensures that the movement of the index
does not get impacted due to corporate actions of the companies in it Appropriate adjustments
are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the closing value of the index
Corporate actions such as bonussplits dividends rights offerings and share changes are applied
on the exdate
All singular instances of changes in equity shares arising out of additional issue of capital such
as ESOPs QIPs ADRGDR issues private placements warrant conversions FCCB conversions
buyback forfeiture of shares etc which have an impact of 5 or more on the issued share
capital of the security are normally implemented on monthly basis effective from the last trading
day of each month after providing a three trading days prior notice In case of any replacement
of index constituent arising from adhoc index review necessitated on account of scheme of
arrangement delisting moving of security to BZ category etc change in shares or free float by
5 or more in all other securities may be clubbed together with such stock replacement
Changes entailing less than 5 impact on the issued share capital or a freefloat are accumulated
and implemented on quarterly basis quarterly rebalancing with effect from the last trading day
of March June September and December
In case of merger of index constituents equity shares investible weight factor of merged entity
shall be updated based on the terms of merger with effect from the exdate T day of merger
ie closing of T1 day

In accordance with the NSEs Capital Market Consolidated Circular dated May 27 2020 Exchange conducts special
preopen session SPOS for the purpose of price discovery of all stocks in cases involving corporate restructuring
If Special PreOpen session is not conducted by Exchange the Demerged company shall be
removed from the index at the beginning of T1 day close of Ex  2 where T day would be the
Ex date for demerger of stock by making a suitable replacement in case of indices with fixed
number of companies No replacement inclusion will be made in case of indices with variable
number of companies
Detailed modalities for handling of corporate action involving demerger are given
hereunder
In order to make adjustments in Nifty equity indices in case of demerger where Exchange
conducts a special preopen session SPOS as stated above following approach shall be
followed
1 For instances of demerger in case of index constituent For example Symbol ABC after
close of market hours on T1 day a dummy symbol For example Symbol ABCD will be
added to the index where T day would be the ex demerger date As addition of dummy
symbol in the index shall be mandatorily made as part of operational guidelines governing
Nifty equity indices for handling corporate action involving demerger separate
announcement shall not be made
2 Dummy symbol ABCD shall represent identical properties of the demerged company symbol
ABC ie number of shares investible weight factor and capping factor etc as may be
applicable for ABC On T day ex demerger day 50 stocks index will be represented by 51
securities with initial price of dummy symbol ABCD set to be zero
3 Exchange conducts special preopen session SPOS for price discovery of companies
undergoing demerger from 9 am to 945 am on Ex day of demerger T day
4 During the SPOS index shall be calculated using the most recently available price of 49 stocks
previous days closing price of ABC 50th security and Zero price of dummy symbol ABCD
5 After the closure of SPOS discovered price of the demerged company  security  ABC and
indicative price of ABCD would be calculated simultaneously as explained below

Once the price is discovered
on any of the subsequent
days then any one of the
above scenarios may apply
Once the price is discovered
on the same day or on any of
the subsequent days then
any one of the above
scenarios may apply
6 Indicative price of dummy symbol ABCD will be computed as a difference between the
previous days closing price of the ABC and the discovered price on ex day of demerger In
case discovered price is greater than or equal to previous closing price price of dummy
security shall be considered as 0
For example
 Closing price of ABC on T1 day  Rs 1000
 Discovered price of ABC Ltd calculated on Ex Day  Rs 600
 Price of dummy symbol ABCD would be calculated derived as Rs 400 Prev close
Rs 1000 minus discovered price Rs 600
 In case discovered price is greater than or equal to previous closing price price of
dummy security shall be considered as 0
7 Once trading in the demerged companys stock ABC moves in the Normal market from
SPOS after the prescribed time ie 1000 am currently index would be computed sourcing
the discovered price of ABC and derived price of dummy symbol ABCD As total
consideration price of ABC and ABCD remains at Rs 1000 there shall be no change in the
initial index value on account of such a price discovery
8 Once demerged company is available for trading under Normal market index shall be
computed based on the latest prices of all index constituents and a constant price of dummy
symbol ABCD as explained earlier on a daily basis till such time new company resulting after
demerger is listed traded at NSE In other words index values will be calculated considering
the real time prices of all index constituents except for dummy symbol and for dummy
symbol ABCD static derived price Rs 400 will be considered till the listing of a new
company resulting out of demerger
9 Weightage of each scrip in the index shall be computed based on the market capitalization
of all securities in the index including the dummy symbol for example 51 securities in 50
stock index
10 From the actual date of listing of spunoff businessentity ABCD beginning of the day
dummy symbol ABCD will be replaced by a new actual symbol new company listed
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 195
subsequent to demerger and index will be calculated based on the prices of this new symbol
This means that a newly listed symbol would form part of the index for a temporary period
as explained in subsequent point During this temporary period new symbol shall not be
screened for compliance with index eligibility criteria
11 New symbol shall be removed from the index after the close of trading on third day of listing
at the market determined price In case during the first 2 days of these 3 days if the spunoff businessentity hits the price band on both the days then the exclusion date shall be
deferred After observing two consecutive days of the spunoff businessentity not hitting
the price band such spunoff businessentity shall be removed after the closing of third day
of such observation The possible scenarios are explained hereunder
Sr No Scenario Action
1 Spun off entity does not hit the price
band on first two trading days of its
listing
Exclusion of spun off entity shall be made
after the close of 3rd trading day of its listing
initial exclusion date
2 Spun off entity hits the price band
on first two trading days of its listing
Exclusion of spun off entity shall be deferred
by another 3 trading days from initial
exclusion date which is after the close of
3rd trading day of its listing In other words
the exclusion shall be made after the close
of 6th trading day instead of the close of 3rd
trading day provided spun off entity does
not hit price band on two consecutive days
prior to its proposed exclusion which is after
the close of 6th trading day
During the first two days post deferment of
initial exclusion date if spun off entity
continues to hit the price band on any
trading day the exclusion of spun off entity
shall be made after the close of next trading
day upon observing two consecutive days of
the spun off entity not hitting the price
band
3 Spun off entity hits the price band
on either first day of its listing or on
second trading day of its listing
Exclusion of spun off entity shall be made
after the close of next trading day upon
observing two consecutive days of the spun
off entity not hitting the price band
Note In each of the above cases a press release announcing exclusion of spun off entity shall
be issued after the close of second consecutive day of the spun off entity not hitting the price
band
12 Demerged company ABC which is retained in the index shall be screened for its continued
eligibility considering data for the period starting the exdate till the last trading day of the
next calendar month and 6 months data for other securities Such demerged company if
found to be the least eligible company to be part of the index based on index eligibility
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 196
criteria shall be replaced in case a suitable replacement is available with effect from the last
trading day of the calendar quarter subject to providing required notice period to market
13 In case of any index constituents undergoing demerger where Exchange is not conducting a
special preopen session SPOS it shall be removed from Nifty indices on beginning of T1
day close of Ex  2 where T day would be the Ex date for demerger of stock by making
suitable replacement in case of indices with fixed number of companies No replacement
inclusion will be made in case of indices with variable number of companies
Announcement of such changes shall be made a minimum of 3 working days in advance for
change in the constituents of indices including the indices on which Futures and Options are
traded at NSE
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 197
Index Calculation Formula
Market capitalizationbased indices price return
Formula for computing price return variant of indices based on market capitalization method
full or freefloat mcap method is as under
Index Value  Index Market Capitalisation  Base Free Float Market Capitalisation of index  Base
Index Value
where Index Market Capitalization  Shares outstanding  IWF  Capping factor  Price
 IWF  1 in case of indices computed based on full market capitalization method
 Capping factor  1 in case of uncapped indices
where Index market capitalisation is the aggregate of market capitalisation of each scrip in the
Index adjusted for free float andor capping factor depending upon the methodology and
Base index value is the initial value assigned to each index For example 1000 or 100
Equal weight factorbased indices price return
Using the divisor and modified index market capitalization Equal weight factorbased indices
are calculated as follows
Index Valuet  Modified Index Market Capitalization  Index Divisort  1000
Modified Index Market Capitalization   Modified Index Sharesi  Pricei
Modified Index Sharesi  Weighti  Modified Index Market Capitalization  Pricei
Modified Index Sharesi on Base date  Weighti  Base Index Divisor  Pricei
Notes
1 As on the base date notional portfolio value of INR 1 billion has been considered as modified
market capitalization and Base Index Divisor
2 Modified index shares are calculated considering modified index market capitalization of the
day prior to the rebalancing date Modified shares are calculated whenever the index is
rebalanced
Nifty Indices  Methodology Document July 2023 20230703 198
Total Return Index Calculation
The total return version of the index is also available which assumes dividends are reinvested in
the index after the close on the exdate Corporate actions like Dividend announcement do not
require any adjustment in the normal price index other than special dividend
All dividend amounts that are greater than or equal to 2 of companys market prices on date
of announcements are considered as a special dividend These dividends are adjusted in price
returns index on ex dividend date and they are further excluded from computation of total
returns index Moreover all dividends that are being paid by the company with shorter notice
to the stock exchange are also adjusted in price return index on ex dividend date and they are
excluded from computation of total returns index
A separate series of index ie Total Returns Index TR is calculated which shows the returns on
Index portfolio inclusive of dividends

Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 2
Our global family of fixed income indices traces its history to 1973 when the first total return bond index was created For nearly fifty
years these indices have been the market standard for fixed income investors seeking objective rulesbased and representative
benchmarks to measure asset class risk and return On August 24 2016 Bloomberg acquired these assets from Barclays Bank PLC
and cobranded the indices as the Bloomberg Barclays Indices for a term of five years From August 24 2021 we refer to them as
the Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices
In addition to the Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices Bloomberg also offers other index families including the Bloomberg AusBond
Commodity BCOM Currency Indices and most recently Equity Indices
 AusBond Indices are the leading fixed income benchmarks for Australia and New Zealand
 BCOM are a family of benchmarks designed to provide liquid and diversified exposure to physical commodities through futures
contracts
 Currency Indices offer a real time measure of the underlying currencies against a diversified dynamic basket of emerging and
developed market currencies
 Equity Indices are a complete set of global families covering over 99 of the available free float market cap in 49 developed
and emerging countries
These among other index families have separate methodologies and are not covered in the scope of this publication These
methodologies are available on the Bloomberg Terminal and on the Bloomberg Index Website wwwbloombergcomindices
While Bloomberg Index Services Limited BISL and with its affiliates Bloomberg publishes a wide range of index primers
factsheets rules documents technical notes and index specific research in support of our products the scope of our offering can
make it a challenge for both new and experienced index users to get a full overview of the methodology in a single publication
This guide supplements these indexspecific documents to detail index rules and methodologies for most of the Bloomberg
Indices in a single publication
In particular this methodology document will cover
 Index eligibility criteria and inclusion rules
 Rebalancing rules and mechanics
 Return calculations analytics and pricing conventions
 Weighting and aggregation rules
Understanding the methodology is an important part of the portfolio management process as such we understand that no single
document will answer every question that an index user may have The index group has dedicated teams of research analysts
globally to work with clients on bespoke index and portfolio management solutions and assist clients with specific questions that
may not be addressed in this methodology We invite readers to direct any further questions they may have to these teams to
facilitate an even stronger dialogue between index users and the research analysts who have put it together

About Bloomberg Indices
BISL has two core index business lines 1 Benchmark Indices and 2 Investable Index Products
While benchmark indices and the risk and return characteristics they provide at the security
sector and asset class levels are a fundamental part of the portfolio management process
index demand has evolved beyond traditional longonly measures of broad market
performance Investors now also use indices to efficiently measure and access beta enhanced
beta and alpha through rigorous and transparent rulesbased index products The suite of
products and services reflects this evolution and offers investors a more comprehensive
approach to portfolio management challenges
The range of products and
services offered by
Bloomberg extends well
beyond benchmark fixed
income indices to include
investable index products
Overview
The Bloomberg index brand is most commonly associated with marketleading fixed income
and inflationlinked benchmark indices such as the Global Aggregate Index and World
Government InflationLinked Bond Index However the range of index products and services
offered by Bloomberg extends beyond benchmark indices to include investable index products
designed to offer access to systematic strategies beta smart beta and alpha across multiple
asset classes fixed income equities commodities FX etc Portfolio analytics and portfolio
modeling are complementary functions available through the PORT portfolio management
platform available through the Bloomberg Terminal
With dedicated teams in the US Europe and Asia Bloomberg is able to offer products and
services for a broad array of investor types and portfolio management functions By firm type
users of Bloomberg Indices and Bloomberg portfolio analytics and services include asset
managers insurance companies pension fundsplan sponsors investment banks commercial
bankstrust banks central banks sovereign wealth funds hedge funds ETF providers
investment consultants and private wealth and retail investors By function investment
professionals that use Bloomberg Indices and Bloomberg portfolio analytics include portfolio
managers investment officers asset allocators performance analysts risk analysts research
analysts traders marketing professionals structurers pricing analysts operations and market
data teams and investment consultants
Benchmark Indices
The Bloomberg Indices are the most widely used fixed income and inflationlinked benchmarks
and are an integral part of the active and passive global portfolio management processes With
broad product coverage a strong history of innovation and objective and transparent rules
BISL has continually been recognized as the top index provider1 Bloomberg Indices are also
the most widely used benchmarks for fixed income exchange traded funds ETFs
The Bloomberg index brand
can trace its roots back more
than 40 years to 1973 with
the launch of the US
Government and US
Corporate Indices
History and Evolution
The Bloomberg Indices can trace their genealogy back to 1973 with the launch of the first
generally available total return bond indices for the US bond market the US Government and
US Investment Grade Corporate Indices At the request of the Bond Portfolio Managers
Association two Kuhn Loeb researchers2 created these new bond market benchmarks on July
7 1973 to offer investors a performance target akin to those that had long been available for
equities At the time bond indices consisting of yield averages had been around for decades
but bond total return indices did not exist
Broad acceptance of total return debt indices took several years however asset management
trends in the 1970s  specifically the need for greater portfolio accountability  contributed to
the demand for such indices By the late 1970s public and private plan sponsors as well as
active money managers had embraced these initial US Government and US Corporate Indices
The US Aggregate Index was
created in 1986
The expansion of the platform remained largely rooted in the US capital markets during the
1980s The Municipal Bond Index was launched in January 1980 to track the market for taxexempt municipal securities in the US In 1986 the GovernmentCredit Index created in 1979
and used as a first generation broadbased measure of investment grade debt was expanded
1 Based on Evestement data for fixed income indices
2 Art Lipson and John Roundtree were analysts at the investment bank Kuhn Loeb  Co when these first two indices were created Kuhn Loeb merged with Lehman
Brothers in 1977 and the fixed income index platform existed as part of the Lehman Brothers research offering through a number of subsequent mergers and spinoffs It
was subsequently acquired by Barclays in 2008 and then by Bloomberg in 2016

to include Mortgage Backed Securities MBS securities This expanded secondgeneration
macro index was called the US Aggregate Index and was backfilled with data to 1976
Since the mid1980s the global debt capital markets have evolved and expanded because of
the acceleration of economic and capital market globalization rapid technological change and
increased availability of information and the steady emergence of new issuers and security
types A substantive high yield corporate market emerged first in the US and later in Europe
Emerging markets EM debt was disintermediated from commercial banks to the public
security markets with new countries issuing debt in hard currency local currency and inflationlinked formats Fixed and floatingrate asset backed securities ABS were issued in the US
Europe and Asia Commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS and agency hybrid ARM
MBS were introduced Inflationlinked bonds and floatingrate notes emerged as distinct fixed
income asset classes Issuance of capital securities hybrid instruments and convertibles
appealing to both debt and equity investors accelerated Interest rate currency and credit
default swaps were created and became widely used as instruments to express market views in
fixed income portfolios Encouraged by the support of our many index users among plan
sponsors money managers consultants issuers and academics the index franchise added
performance metrics for these new debt asset classes to match the pace of market innovation
with benchmark indices
The Euro Aggregate Index
was launched in 1998 the
Global Aggregate in 1999
and the AsianPacific
Aggregate in 2000
Indices for new asset classes such as inflationlinked bonds3 ABS CMBS and EM were
introduced in the 1990s The multicurrency Global Treasury Index was launched in 1992 A third
generation of macro indices including the US Universal Index 1999 tracking investment grade
and high yield debt in one benchmark was originated In tandem with market and asset
management evolution the index franchise became a truly global platform with the creation of
the Euro Aggregate Index in July 1998 PanEuropean Aggregate Index in January 1999 AsianPacific Aggregate Index in July 2000 and Global Aggregate Index in January 1999 The Global
Aggregate has seen steady expansion into new investment grade debt markets since its initial
launch and now tracks 24 different local currency debt markets
In 1997 the first Index Advisory Council was held in the US to collect external feedback to be
used in the governance of benchmark indices Subsequent Index Advisory Councils have been
held globally in London Singapore and Tokyo as part of the formal index governance process
In the 2000s US and Euro FloatingRate Notes Indices the Global Capital Securities Floating
Rate ABS Indices and a Taxable Municipal Index were introduced In 2002 the Canadian
Aggregate Index was launched and in March 2003 a US Convertibles Index was created with
subsequent EMEA and APAC Convertibles Indices launched in 2010 and 2011 respectively
Local currency indices for China 2004 Russia 2006 and India 2007 were launched to delve
deeper into new local currency debt markets In 2007 the EM Government InflationLinked
Bond Index further expanded both the inflationlinked and EM index families In 2010 a
standalone EM Local Currency Government Index family was launched tracking both Global
Aggregate eligible and nonGlobal Aggregate eligible nominal local currency government
debt In 2012 the LDI Index family was launched as a new replicable benchmark for US liability
driven investors
The evolution of indices continues at Bloomberg In March 2017 Global Aggregate  China and
EM Local Currency Government  China Indices were launched to incorporate Chinas RMBdenominated government and policy bank debt In March 2018 Bloomberg began adding
Chinese RMBdenominated government and policy bank debt into the flagship Global
Aggregate Index in April 2019
Recent innovations in smart
beta indices include the
launch of GDP Weighted

Weighted Indices ESG
themed indices and Duration
Hedged Indices
While the primary expansion of the Bloomberg index platform has focused on added coverage
of new asset classes and a quest to fully map the global fixed income debt markets there has
also been parallel development to create new measures of already covered asset classes that
reflect alternative investment themes In 2009 floatadjusted versions of Bloomberg Indices
that exclude publicly announced government holdings were introduced as well as GDP
weighted versions of existing flagship indices such as the Global Treasury Global Aggregate
and Euro Treasury Indices In 2011 Fiscal Strength Weighted Indices further expanded
alternative weight index offerings integrating objective measures of a governments financial
solvency dependence on external financing capacity and governance to determine index
3 Inflationlinked indices were independently launched and offered under the Barclays and Lehman Brothers brands These indices were unified under a single brand in
September 2008 but remained as two distinct offerings SeriesB and SeriesL Indices respectively

weights In 2013 Bloomberg MSCI ESG Fixed Income Indices were introduced to offer debt
investors a new market standard for benchmarks that formally integrate Environmental Social
and Governance criteria into their design In addition Bloomberg Mirror Futures and Duration
Hedged Indices were introduced in 2013 to provide investors with fixed income benchmarks
that replicate and hedge interest rate duration exposure of existing flagship indices using liquid
futures contracts In 2014 the Green Bond family of indices was launched to track bonds that
use proceeds for environmental purposes
Product Coverage
Bloomberg offers a comprehensive set of fixed income benchmarks spanning the investment
grade high yield inflationlinked hard and local currency EM municipal and convertible
markets Product coverage is currently at more than 70000 securities with over USD50trn in
market value representing 120 countries and 42 local currency debt markets Bloomberg
publishes more than 40000 standard and bespoke indices daily Figure 2 illustrates the
coverage of flagship benchmark index families
Benchmark Index Solutions
Benchmark indices are used by global investors for three primary purposes 1 as portfolio
performance targets 2 as informational measures of securitylevel and asset class risk and
return characteristics and 3 as references for indexlinked products Bloomberg offers index
users a number of benchmarkrelated services and solutions supporting these primary uses in
the portfolio management process
Customized Benchmark Index Solutions
With the proliferation of standard benchmark indices offered as part of the benchmark index
platform there has been increased demand for bespoke measures of asset classes that may be
more consistent with investorspecific portfolio objectives
Bloomberg recognizes that no single benchmark design is universal or appropriate for all
investors Our goal is to offer a broad and evolving suite of unbiased index products from which
investors may select or customize the most appropriate benchmark for their portfolio needs In
addition to our flagship indices Bloomberg now publishes thousands of bespoke benchmarks
and actively works with index users in a consultative manner on benchmark design

Replication Strategies
The index team offers tools for clients seeking to passively replicate fixed income benchmarks
with cash bonds andor isolate fixed income beta through other strategies and products so that
it may be repackaged in new ways eg portable alpha strategies Bloomberg also licenses its
indices to third parties for use in index replication products such as ETFs

Benchmark Index Design Principles
The widespread use of Bloomberg benchmark indices suggests they have become the market
standard for investors seeking objective and intuitive measures of the fixed income asset class
while providing sufficient flexibility and adaptability to offer bespoke solutions to meet a
specific investors constraints preferences or guidelines One reason for such widespread
usage is that the underlying eligibility criteria for bonds in the Bloomberg Indices adhere to the
following core design principles required for any good benchmark
 Representative of the market or asset class being measured and the desired risk exposures
sought by index users
 Replicable offering a sufficiently sized universe without unnecessary turnover and
transaction costs
 Objective and transparent with clearly defined and objective rules as well as daily visibility
into current index composition and future composition during rebalancing
 Relevant as investment benchmarks for a diverse set of index uses including both actively
and passively managed portfolios
The Bloomberg Indices are designed to meet these fundamental criteria as all indices are rulesbased with inclusion determined by transparent eligibility criteria that have been set to
accurately and comprehensively measure different fixed income asset classes Additionally
comprehensive statistics for each index are readily available to index users with performance
statistics available daily for most indices
The principal objective of this
methodology document is to
guide users through each step
of index design to better
understand the rules
methodologies conventions
and governance of
Bloomberg Indices
Design Principles
Understanding Portfolio Uses of Benchmark Indices
Bloomberg tends to observe three common uses for fixed income indices which influence
preferences in index design and benchmark construction
Portfolio Performance Targets
The most common use of indices is as a baseline performance target or benchmark for active or
passive bond portfolios While some investors and market participants may think of benchmarks
solely in the context of expost performance analysis index data are used at many different
stages of the portfolio management process eg asset allocation security selection and exante portfolio risk analysis
Informational Measures of Asset Class Risk and Return
In addition to benchmark performance fixed income indices are often used as informational
measures of market performance and risk characteristics Within this context firms use index
data in a variety of functions in the development backtesting evaluation and implementation
of investment strategies and market analysis
References for IndexLinked Products
Finally Bloomberg benchmark indices are used as a reference target for passive investment
strategies and indexlinked products such as ETFs ETNs and structured notes
Given the variety of uses Bloomberg recognizes that no single benchmark design is universal
or appropriate for all investors The goal of Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices is to offer a broad
innovative and evolving suite of fixed income indices from which investors are able to select or
customize the most appropriate benchmark for their portfolio needs The right fixed income
index can be viewed as the most appropriate and replicable benchmark for a specific portfolio
objective within the context of the dedicated portfolio as well as part of an overall asset
allocation mix As an index provider Bloomberg remains impartial to the benchmark selection
decisions made by investors

No single benchmark design is universal or appropriate for all investors The goal of Bloomberg Indices is to offer
a broad innovative and evolving suite of fixed income indices from which investors are able to select or customize
the most appropriate benchmark for their portfolio needs
Fundamental Design Questions to Construct a Fixed Income Index
Each benchmark within the Bloomberg benchmark index platform can be differentiated and
summarized by the answers to three fundamental design questions central to all indices 1 what
investment universe is the index intending to measure 2 how are the return and risk
characteristics of indexeligible securities measured and 3 how are securitylevel returns and
risk characteristics weighted and aggregated to the index level
What investment universe is the index trying to measure
The answer here defines the universe of securities that an investor considers to be part of their
choice set This can be explicitly defined in an investors portfolio guidelines but may also
include a broader risk budget to outofindex securities not specified by investment guidelines
From that defined universe the benchmark must define indexeligible securities with objective
rulesbased and transparent eligibility criteria that represent and measure the desired asset
class
How are the risk and return characteristics of eligible securities measured
Once an investmentindex universe is defined these securities must be measured from both a
return pricing coupon and principal payments and a risk duration convexity and spread
perspective
How are securitylevel returns and risk characteristics weighted and aggregated to the
index level
With these securitylevel risk and return characteristics measured they must then be
aggregated to a summary or index level How frequently the indices are rebalanced and how
the relative weights of indexeligible securities are determined are key considerations to arrive
at a final index construction
The principal objective of this document is to guide index users through each of these steps of
the index design process to better understand existing index rules methodologies and
conventions for flagship Bloomberg Indices and their evolution
Bloomberg Benchmark Index Governance

Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 12
Benchmark Index Eligibility Rules
Bloomberg Fixed Income benchmark indices are constructed to measure the risk and return
characteristics of the global fixed income markets in an objective manner Though the eligibility
criteria of specific indices will vary all benchmarks adhere to prudent index construction
standards and guidelines
Most importantly Bloomberg benchmarks are rulesbased objective and transparent Index
inclusion of individual securities and the application of published index rules are determined by
clearly defined published eligibility criteria
Index rules are continually monitored and reviewed by Bloomberg through a formal
governance process that seeks stakeholder feedback to ensure they remain relevant and
representative of asset class changes in an evolving market
A common core set of
securitylevel attributes are
used to determine index
eligibility for most fixed
income indices
The central design of any fixed income index starts with an evaluation of security attributes to
determine whether a bond will be index eligible as of the rebalancing date While the threshold
for inclusion varies from index to index most benchmarks evaluate a core set of common
attributes
This section explains the most commonly used bond index eligibility criteria and how they are
applied to a variety of Bloomberg benchmark fixed income index families The criteria include
 Currency denomination of a bonds principal and interest payments
 Sector classification of the bond issuer recognizing the wide range of issuer types in the
fixed income market including corporate government and securitized borrowers
 Credit quality of a bond as measured by the ratings agencies Moodys Standard and
Poors and Fitch5 This is important for index users with investment guidelines that make a
clear distinction between investment grade rated Baa and higher and high yield rated Ba
and lower securities
 Amount outstanding of a bond with larger bonds generally more widely held by investors
and viewed as more liquid
 Time to maturity of a bonds principal repayment
 Country of risk of the issuing entity especially in cases where an investor may make a
distinction between developed and emerging markets in their portfolios
 Market of issueplacement type of a security reflecting whether a bond is or will soon be
publicly registered exempt from registration or privately placed This also indicates whether
a bond is being marketed and sold to local investors only nonlocal investors or globally
offered in multiple markets
 Taxability of a securitys cash flows and principal payments from an issuers and an
investors perspective From the issuer perspective distinctions are made when cash
payments are made by a borrower on a pretax basis debt vs aftertax basis equity
dividend From the investor perspective bonds that offer taxexempt proceeds particularly
US municipal securities are generally bought by a different investor base than taxable
bonds
 Subordination of a security which identifies where an investors claim is within the
borrowers capital structure distinguishing between bonds that have senior claims and
those that have subordinated claims in a credit event
Additional attributes that are used to determine index inclusion include whether a bond
contains explicit optionality on the earlier repayment of principal callable putable etc the
coupon type used to determine interest payments fixed vs floatingrate as well as other
considerations such as sanctions 6
5 Canada Aggregate family of indices additionally employ DBRS bond ratings beginning in August 2018
6 New debt from issuers on either the US Office of Financial Assets Control OFAC sectoral sanctions identification list that are considered restricted transactions for US
persons or on the EU sanctions list are not eligible for Bloomberg Indices Existing debt currently included in indices is typically eligible but may be reviewed to see how
the sectoral sanctions have affected their liquidity and investability If sanctions are lifted the Bloomberg Index team will review the affected bonds to determine whether
they have become eligible to reenter the index provided they still meet all other index eligibility criteria
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 13
As fixed income markets continue to evolve new types of bond features and structures are
brought to market When evaluating new security types for the purposes of index eligibility
Bloomberg takes a number of factors into account including but not limited to existing index
rules eligibility precedents of similar types of debt and the views of clients and internal research
teams Often index eligibility rules are reviewed as part of the formal index governance
process
For questions regarding the eligibility of particular instrument types or other index rules
clarifications not addressed in this chapter please contact the index group
Currency
The currency of a bonds interest and principal cash flows is a primary attribute used by
investors to segment the global fixed income market They may seek returns in their native
currency or be willing to take additional foreign exchange risk as a source of return The
Bloomberg benchmark index platform offers broadbased indices denominated in a single
currency such as the US Aggregate USD and Euro Aggregate EUR Indices as well as
multicurrency benchmarks such as the Global Aggregate and EM Local Currency Government
Indices Returns on multicurrency indices are calculated on both an unhedged and a currency
hedged basis in a number of reporting currencies Additionally returns for singlecurrency
indices are available in currencies other than that of the index
For index purposes the determination of a bonds currency is generally straightforward as its
prospectus and other publicly available sources will clearly state the currency denomination of
principal and coupon payments The primary index consideration is whether a particular local
currency bond market should qualify for certain broadbased indices Bloomberg evaluates
local currency inclusion candidates for benchmarks such as the Global Aggregate and EM Local
Currency Government to ensure that inclusion candidates meet broader index rules and are
sufficiently investable Local currency debt markets may also be removed from existing indices if
there is a significant impairment to the investability of the market
A bonds currency is also important for identifying the appropriate reference curves to calculate
security risk characteristics duration convexity spread etc
Local currency debt market
eligibility in broadbased
indices is reviewed annually
by Bloomberg as part of its
formal governance process
Local Currency Market Inclusion
The eligibility of local currency debt markets in broadbased multicurrency indices is reviewed
annually by Bloomberg Historical inclusion by market is listed in Figure 3
Global Aggregate Index Market Inclusion
To be a candidate for inclusion in broadbased investment grade indices such as the Global
Aggregate Index a local currency debt market must exhibit several necessary but not
sufficient characteristics
 Sovereign debt rating long term local currency must be investment grade using the index
credit quality classification methodology middle rating of Moodys Fitch and SP
 The currency must be freely tradable and convertible and not exposed to exchange
controls that are designed to encumber its buying and selling by foreign investors
 There must be an established and developed forward market or nondeliverable
forward NDF market for the local currency such that foreign market participants can
hedge their exposures into core currencies
Other aspects of local market investability market size settlement and clearing capital controls
and tax regimes secondary market liquidity accessibility for foreign investors etc are
considered when assessing a markets potential inclusion
EM Local Currency Government Index Market Inclusion
Local market inclusion in flagship Emerging Markets Local Currency indices is also evaluated on
an annual basis and requires an established forward or NDF market for hedging for offshore
investors The initial criterion for inclusion in this index family is whether a country is classified as
an emerging market under the indices EM definition
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 14
New market inclusion is also based on a minimum market size requirement of USD5bn of indexeligible debt Other EMspecific evaluations of investability including capital controls and local
market accessibility for offshore investors are considered
Because the accessibility of local EM debt is variable and often depends on whether an investor
has an onshore presence markets commonly characterized as difficult to gain exposure to7 are
not included in the flagship EM Local Currency Government Index but instead are eligible for
the broader EM Local Currency Government Universal Index The Croatian Egyptian Indian
and Taiwanese government bond markets are tracked but included only in the EM Local
Government Universal Index the broadest measure of EM local debt8
EM Local Currency Bonds that Settle Globally
Globally settled bonds that pay principal and accrue interest in local currency but settle in USD
are classified as local currency bonds and qualify for local currency benchmarks These
securities offer exposure to local currency government debt both sovereign credit and local
FX and are less likely to be subjected to local taxation than locally settled bonds These bonds
became eligible for the EM Local Currency Government Index on March 1 2011
World Government InflationLinked Bond Index WGILB Market Inclusion
The WGILB is designed to include only those markets and securities in which a global
government linker fund is likely and able to invest To be considered for index inclusion any
new market must first satisfy the credit rating threshold of A3A for G7 and euro area countries
and Aa3Aa otherwise using the index credit quality methodology
Having fulfilled the qualitative assessment an eligible market must then fulfil the minimum
market size criterion New eligible markets must meet a minimum market size based on
uninflated amount outstanding of USD4bn using Refinitiv WMReuters Closing Spot Rates at
4pm London time as of the last business day of each quarter If an eligible market meets the
minimum market size it will be added to the WGILB at the end of the following quarter
The quarterly market size assessment applies only to developed markets that have initiated a
new linker program or revived an inactive one For markets already included in the WGILB
Index market size is reviewed on an annual basis concurrently with the annual governance
process Once added to the WGILB the threshold for each market is lowered to USD2bn to
prevent unnecessary turnover due to shortterm fluctuations particularly in foreign exchange
The most recent WGILB additions New Zealand NZD and Denmark DKK were
announced as having eligible currencies for the WGILB following the 2012 annual governance
process Subsequently New Zealand satisfied the market size criterion at the end of third
quarter of 2013 and NZDdenominated inflationlinked bonds were subsequently included at
yearend 2013 Denmark satisfied the market size criterion at yearend 2013 and a DKKdenominated inflationlinked government bond was subsequently included at the end of first
quarter of 2014
7 This is generally due to the presence of capital controls quotas or other institutional constraints

Sector
Sector classifications categorize bonds by industry government affiliation or some other
grouping of ultimate issuer risk and are the basis for many key decisions in the portfolio
management process benchmark selection asset allocation security selection risk budgeting
etc Granular by design Bloomberg sector classifications are hierarchal and allow for
comparisons across sectors and within a specific peer group of issuers with similar risk
characteristics
The fixed income asset class presents layers of complexity far greater than those in commonly
used equity classification schemes because of the diversity of issuer and security types In
addition to corporate issuers and central government borrowers a broad universe of
governmentrelated entities supranationals local governments government agencies and
securitized structures with bankruptcy remote issuers or ringfenced assets must be classified
appropriately
The Bloomberg global
classification scheme uses
four pillars to classify bonds
by issuer type
Bloomberg Fixed Income Classification System
The Bloomberg global sector classification scheme is a widely accepted standard for investors
benchmarked to the flagship Bloomberg aggregate bond indices or a sectorbased subcomponent of these indices It is designed to reflect the large universe of corporate
government governmentrelated and securitized bonds that comprise the global fixed income
investment choice set In addition to corporate bonds this universe also includes central
government sovereigntreasury bonds governmentrelated or quasisovereign bonds and
securitized bonds backed by a pool of assets rather than the unsecured credit of an issuer9
The indices sector classification scheme has been modified over the years to recognize the
evolution of certain industries and security types where the existing classification scheme was
not representative of relevant peer groups Additionally increased granularity has been added
for sectors that have grown and where meaningful distinctions have become warranted As
such paramount design objectives for the global classification scheme include providing a
framework that is both enduring and allows for meaningful peer group comparisons10
Indexeligible bonds are divided into one of four broad categories treasury governmentrelated corporate and securitized Within each broad sector there are up to three additional
layers depending on the depth and heterogeneity of issuers within the market The indices

9 The sector classification scheme is designed to classify issuer types It does not make distinctions based on country of risk such as emerging vs developed market or
security type taxable vs taxexempt municipals
10 One key consideration in the definition of sector and subsector peer groups is size Additional granularity can always be offered to isolate issuers with similar risk
characteristics but for index purposes it is important that a particular sector or subsector is not too sparsely populated to facilitate relevant comparisons
11 The Bloomberg Fixed Income Classification System has been designed for fixed income securities and may at times diverge from the Bloomberg BICS classification
scheme which was designed for equities

Sector Hierarchy and Definitions for Taxable Indices
The following section details the classifications used at the first second third and fourth levels
within the indices where applicable
The treasury sector includes
debt issued by central
governments in its native
currency
Treasury Class 1
The treasury sector includes native currency debt issued by central governments These bonds
are backed by the full faith and credit of a central government and represent one of the largest
most liquid segments of the global bond market There are no subclassifications under
treasury though index users will typically use additional segmentations by country or currency
when evaluating this sector Both nominal and inflationlinked native currency government debt
is classified within the treasury sector
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 18
A minimum 50 ownership
rule is used to classify issuers
as government agencies
GovernmentRelated Class 1
The governmentrelated sector groups all issuers with government affiliations in a single
category It has four subsectors Agencies Sovereign Supranational and Local Authority In the
case of Agencies Class 2 there is further granularity at the Class 3 level
 Agencies Class 2 This broad category is designed to capture all issuers that are owned
sponsored or whose payments are guaranteed by a government The three subclassifications are
 Government Guaranteed Class 3 Issues that carry direct guarantees of timely
payment of interest and principal from central governments or from government
agencies that carry direct guarantees from central government Government ownership
is not a factor although most entities will be government owned
 Government Owned No Guarantee Class 3 Issuers that are 50 or more owned by
central governments12 but issue debt that carries no guarantee of timely repayment This
includes direct ownership by governments as well as indirect ownership through other
government owned entities This sector also includes stateowned entities that operate
under special public sector laws Entities that are less than 50 government owned are
classified in the appropriate corporate bucket unless the entity fits the definition of
government sponsored
 Government Sponsored Class 3 Entities that are less than 50 owned by central
governments and that have no guarantee but carry out government policies and benefit
from closeness to the central government Evidence of closeness includes government
charters governmentnominated board members government subsidies for carrying
out social policies provisions for lines of credit and government policies executed at
submarket rates with accompanying economic support from the government
 Local Authority Class 2 Debt issued directly by local authorities and by entities that are
50 or more owned by one or more local authorities In the US market taxable municipal
bonds including Build America Bonds BABs fall into this category Entities less than 50
owned by a local authority will be classified within the appropriate corporate bucket
 Sovereign Class 2 The sovereign sector contains debt issued directly by central
governments but denominated in a currency other than the governments native one Due
to the issuers inherent foreign currency risk investors often classify these bonds separately
from native currency treasury debt
 Supranational Class 2 This sector covers international organizations whose stakeholders
extend beyond a specific nation
Corporate Class 1
The corporate classification and accompanying hierarchy is the most detailed component of the
Bloomberg Indices sector classification scheme It is a global scheme that has been developed
and refined over the years to categorize issuers across geographic markets based on their
primary lines of business revenue streams and operations that are used to service their debt
Classifications are frequently reviewed by the index group in response to market events
changes in an issuers ownership structure mergers and acquisitions divestitures or changes in
the primary line of business New classifications may be added on an asneeded basis if a large
segment of the market exhibits a welldefined risk profile that is not categorized in the existing
scheme though these types of changes are uncommon
While some fixed income sectors may appear comparable to equity sectors they are not
interchangeable and are often different in definition composition and placement within a
broader hierarchy The indices bond classifications are specific to the global debt market and
consist of peer group definitions that include publicly traded issues as well as debt issued by
privately held companies that may have different issuance patterns
The corporate sector is categorized into three broad categories at the second level of the
classification scheme Industrial Financial Institutions and Utilities Further classifications at the
12 The 50 ownership threshold provides a clear and objective delineation between governmentrelated and corporate issuers The rule promotes consistency in
implementation and is based on measurable ownership information which is generally publicly available

Securitized Class 1
The securitized sector is designed to capture fixed income instruments whose payments are
backed or directly derived from a pool of assets that is protected or ringfenced from the credit
of a particular issuer either by bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle or bond covenant
Underlying collateral for securitized bonds can include residential mortgages commercial
13 Textiles sector was retired on July 1 2014
14 In July 2014 Class 4 subsectors for Distributors and Pipelines were retired Pipeline issuers and noninvestment grade natural gas distributors were reclassified to the
newly created Midstream subsector and investment grade natural gas distributors remained under Natural Gas
15 Prior to 2014 this sector was solely named Brokerage Many issuers within this sector moved from brokerage to banking in 2008 when many brokerdealers
reorganized as bank holding companies
16 In October 2003 the sector captive finance was removed from the index classification schema All securities in it were reclassified to reflect the sector of the parent
company Captive finance companies are subsidiaries whose purpose is to provide financing to customers buying the parent companys product They are usually wholly
owned by the parent company Although there are numerous examples the best known one is in the automotive industry General Motors has General Motors
Acceptance Corporation GMAC Daimler Chrysler has Chrysler Financial and the Ford Motor Company has Ford Motor Credit Company FMCC In July 2014
remaining NonCaptive Consumer and NonCaptive Diversified subsectors were retired and collapsed into the single Class 3 Finance Companies category
17 Industrial issuers that have reorganized or are structured as REITS for tax purposes are classified within their respective industrial peer group

mortgages public sector loans auto loans or credit card payments18 There are four main subcomponents of the securitized sector MBS PassThrough ABS CMBS and Covered
 MBS PassThrough Class 2 Fixed income structures that pool residential mortgage loans
with similar characteristics into a mortgage backed security and then allocate principal and
interest payments of underlying loans to bond holders This sector includes agency and
nonagency issuers but only agency issuers FNMA FHLMC and GNMA are eligible for the
indices19 Beginning July 2019 the indices reflect both 45 and 55day delay Freddie
securities to reflect the UMBS initiative
 Agency FixedRate Class 3 Subsectors include GNMA 30 Year GNMA 15 Year
Conventional 30 Year Conventional 20 Year and Conventional 15 Year20
 NonAgency Class 3 This classification captures nonagency mortgage passthroughs
in the US and mortgage passthroughs denominated in nonUSD currencies
 ABS Class 2 Within ABS Class 3 subsectors are based on collateral types though not all
are represented in fixed or floatingrate indices auto credit card residential mortgages
stranded cost utility student loans and whole business21
 CMBS Class 2 CMBS are backed by commercial real estate loans or multifamily
properties Effective July 2014 Class 3 subsectors differentiate between agency CMBS and
nonagency CMBS Other index classifications are used in this market CMBS 20 ERISAeligible etc to segment the asset class further but they are not part of the core
classification scheme
 Covered Class 2 Covered bonds are recourse debt instruments that are secured by a
ringfenced pool of assets on an issuers balance sheet commercial real estate residential
mortgages public sector loans or other assets22 Investors having recourse to the originator
is the defining difference between covered bonds and ABS23 Securities that are issued
under the Pfandbriefe Act in Germany and similar bonds in other jurisdictions nonPfandbriefe are classified as covered bonds under this definition
 Mortgage Collateralized Class 3 Bonds collateralized by residential and commercial
real estate Class 4 subsectors include Pfandbriefe Jumbo Pfandbriefe and NonPfandbriefe Danish MBS are classified as NonPfandbriefe
 Public Sector Collateralized Class 3 Bonds collateralized by public sector loans
Class 4 subsectors include Pfandbriefe Jumbo Pfandbriefe and NonPfandbriefe public
sector loans
 Hybrid Collateralized Class 3 Bonds collateralized by a combination of public sector
loans mortgages andor other assets24
 Other Class 3 Bonds collateralized by single asset classes other than real estate or
public sector loans Two Class 4 subsectors distinguish between Pfandbriefe and NonPfandbriefe
Bloomberg looks at several
factors when assigning a new
classification or reviewing a
current classification
Sector Assignment and Reclassifications
Bloomberg looks at a number of factors when assigning a Fixed Income sector classification or
reviewing a current classification These include an issuers business lines and sources of
revenue as well as an evaluation of comparable companies with similar risk profiles or
organizational structures Sector classification can change due to various factors
18 Instruments such as CMOs that package other bonds into a new security are not indexeligible
19 Hybrid ARMs Class 3 sector was retired on June 1 2017
20 MBS balloons were retired on January 1 2008
21 ABS home equity loan sector was retired on October 1 2009 and manufactured housing sector was retired on January 1 2008 Starting from May 1 2021 the ABS
sector also includes motorcycle ABS under the Auto ABS class equipment ABS under Other ABS class and device payment plan also under Other ABS class
22 For purposes of rules clarity the Covered Bond Index will exclude bonds that primarily contain fixed income securities issued by third parties other than the issuer in
the cover pool
23 The category includes structured covered bonds for which securitization techniques have been used to enhance the rating of the covered bonds but the issuing
entity is usually not bankruptcy remote Structured covered issues are not governed by national covered bond legislation and regulation while covered bonds are
where such guidelines exist These bonds fall under Other Covered at the Class 3 level
24 There are no hybrid Pfandbriefe so there are no Class 4 subsectors
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 21
 Corporate Actions In the case of corporate actions such as a merger acquisition or spinoff the classifications may be updated to better reflect the business lines of the new
entities25 For example in January 2013 Abbott Laboratories spun off its pharmaceutical
business into a separate entity AbbVie The Abbott Laboratories bonds were reclassified
from Consumer NonCyclical  Pharmaceuticals to Consumer NonCyclical  Healthcare to
reflect the business line of the remaining entity after the separation
 Change in Government Ownership A move between corporate and governmentrelated
may result from a decrease or increase in a governments ownership stake26 In March 2013
for example the ownership stake of the Japanese government in Japan Tobacco Inc
decreased from 525 to 367 after a Japan Tobacco Inc share repurchase and secondary
offering As a result the sector for JAPTOB bonds in the indices was updated from
GovernmentRelated  Agencies to Industrial  Consumer NonCyclical  Tobacco While
membership in broadbased AsianPacific Aggregate and Global Aggregate Indices was not
affected the JAPTOB bonds did become eligible for corporate subindices of the broadbased aggregate benchmarks
 Evolution of Business Lines If the business lines of a corporate entity shift it could be
reclassified to reflect its new peer group For example in January 2013 Ally Financial Inc
issues were reclassified to reflect the firms increased operations as a traditional bank
holding company and migration away from a legacy finance company structure The
classification for bonds within the indices was updated from Financial Institutions  Finance
Companies to Financial Institutions  Banking
Issuers with diverse business lines can present a challenge when cases can be made for
multiple classifications Whether assigning a classification to a new issuer or reviewing
classifications of existing ones Bloomberg evaluates all publicly available information on a
given entity to assign the most appropriate classification
Evolution of the Bloomberg Fixed Income Classification System
As discussed above bonds are divided into four main sectors at the Class 1 level in the
Bloomberg classification scheme Prior to January 2005 a threepillar scheme was used
classifying bonds into government27 credit and securitized sectors at the first level One of the
primary reasons for the sector changes made in 2005 was to make the scheme global in nature
and not reflective of the perspective of a single region Consequently the notion of foreign in
existing classifications used in the foreign local agencies and foreign local government sectors
was removed and the bonds were reclassified within the new governmentrelated sector The
change eliminated classification differences arising when government government agencies
and local authorities issue bonds in their native domestic and nonnative foreign currencies
The governmentrelated sector introduced in 2005 was designed to categorize issuerlevel risk
in a more descriptive manner by grouping all issuers with government affiliations separately
from treasury or corporate issuers Moreover the three subclassifications within the Agencies
sector government guarantee government owned no guarantee and government sponsored
more accurately segregated agency issuers based on their government relationships Figure 5
provides the relationship between the classification scheme before and after the change
25 Due to potential uncertainty and complications surrounding corporate actions changes to classifications for index purposes take effect after the close of transaction
rather than following the announcement
26 Over the years governmentowned entities have been candidates for full or partial privatization These processes can often be time consuming reflecting their oftenpolitical nature and the difficulties in evaluating the companies as standalone entities Taking into account such factors privatization candidates are moved to the
appropriate corporate sector only when their share sales take place not when they are first announced
27 While the threepillar scheme has been retired many benchmark indices are still based off the government definition of nativecurrency agency bonds and
treasuries Legacy SeriesB indices including Bloomberg Government InflationLinked and Bloomberg Government SeriesB Indices define government as
including only treasury bonds local currency debt issued by central governments

Figure 5
Bloomberg Sector Classification Scheme Before and After January 1 2005
The most recent changes effective July 2014 include the creation of several new sectors at the
Class 3 and Class 4 levels renaming of certain existing sectors and retirement of others
Municipal Index Classifications
Due to the unique nature of this asset class Bloomberg uses a classification scheme that is
unique to the risk factors associated with the municipal market for related indices
Municipal Index Classifications
For the taxexempt municipal market bonds in the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index are
categorized into the following sector types28
1 PreRefunded Bonds backed by special US Treasury issuance or other high quality bonds
this supersedes all other sector designations
2 General Obligation GO Bonds that have not been prerefunded and are backed by the
credit of the issuing entity not a directed revenue stream or project
3 Revenue Bonds that have not been prerefunded that are backed by revenue generating
projects as a funding source
28 Effective November 2019 US Municipals classification system was enhanced with extra granularity and a previously used fourth sector type Insured has been retired

Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 24
Credit Quality
The credit rating of a security is a key classification in the fixed income market with a clear
distinction between investment grade Baa3BBB or higher and high yield Ba1BB or lower
debt Investment grade and high yield portfolios are often managed separately though
portfolio guidelines may allow a certain degree of crossover which requires a clear rulesbased
delineation for index purposes
An added layer of complexity exists in the assignment of credit quality because the rating
agencies used in index classifications Moodys Standard  Poors and Fitch may assign a
different rating to the same security Bloomberg uses multiple ratings sources to classify
securities appropriately including bondlevel ratings from the different agencies issuer ratings
and foreign or local currency sovereign debt ratings
Bloomberg uses the middle
rating of Moodys SP and
Fitch to determine a securitys
credit classification for most
indices
Bloomberg Index Rating
Bloomberg uses the middle rating of Moodys SP and Fitch29 to determine a securitys credit
classification or index rating30 This essentially works as a twooutofthree rule because at
least two of the three agencies need to rate a bond as investment grade to qualify it for
investment grade indices or two agencies to rate it as high yield to qualify it for the high yield
indices
If only two agencies rate a security the more conservative lower rating is used If only one
rates a security that single rating is used Situations where no security level ratings are available
are discussed later in this section31
Below are three examples using specific issues as of August 31 2018
1 Murphy Oil Corp 705 Coupon Maturing May 1 2029
Moodys Rating Ba3
SP Rating BBBFitch Rating BB
Index Rating Ba2BB
Despite SPs investment grade rating of BBB this issue is still classified as high yield for
index purposes since Moodys and Fitch have it rated as high yield
2 Devon Energy Corp 56 Coupon Maturing July 15 2041
Moodys Rating Ba1
SP Rating BBB
Fitch Rating BBB
Index Rating Baa2BBB
This issue has an index rating of Baa2BBB because the Moodys rating lowest and the
Fitch rating highest would be dropped
Sysco Corp Coupon 33 Maturing July 15 2026
Moodys Rating A3
SP Rating BBB
Fitch Rating NR
Index Rating Baa1BBB
This issue has an index classification of Baa1BBB as Fitch rating is not available and the
more conservative SP rating of the two available ratings is taken
29 Bloomberg does not currently supplement the ratings of Moodys Fitch and SP with that of other ratings agencies for most asset classes or subsets of the global
fixed income markets for index purposes except the Canadian Aggregate Indices However the use of additional ratings sources is reviewed with index users on a
periodic basis through the annual governance process
30 Though SP and Fitch ratings are used in determining an index rating Moodys nomenclature is used for all bonds Ratings may be solicited or unsolicited
31 The only indices that additionally employ a fourth rating agency DBRS in the determination of index rating are the Canadian Aggregate family of indices beginning on
August 1 2018 For these indices only index rating is determined by removing the highest and lowest of four ratings and taking the lower of the two remaining ratings If
fewer than four ratings are available the existing standard methodology based on three or fewer ratings is used
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 25
Evolution of the Index Rating Methodology
Bloomberg has revised the rules used for credit quality classification over the years to
incorporate additional information about issuersissues that would 1 enhance the usability and
design of the indices 2 prevent sudden and unwanted turnover due to ratings changes and 3
offer multiple views on issuer credit worthiness especially in cases where there may be
differences in opinion32
Of the three agencies used for most indices Fitch ratings were most recently incorporated into
the index rules on credit quality in July 2005 Prior to 2005 the index rating was assigned by
taking the lower or more conservative of SP and Moodys ratings The addition of Fitch
afforded a more consensus opinion in addition to promoting longerterm index rating stability
The advantage of this method as opposed to a most conservative rule is that at least two
agencies need to agree on a rating to prompt an index rating change33
The original method to classify bonds by credit quality within the indices applied a 50 split of
a securitys index weight based on Moodys and SP ratings for investment grade indices when
both ratings were available However this approach proved suboptimal in cases of splitrated
issues bonds rated investment grade by one agency and noninvestment grade by the other
agency where only half of the securitys weight was included in the investment grade index As
a result on August 1 1988 the method was revised to use Moodys as the primary rating agency
for index classification with SP as the secondary source where Moodys did not rate an issue
This clear easily followed rule remained for a time but investor interest for a more inclusive
approach that did not rely on a single arbiter of credit quality prompted a change in 200334 On
October 1 2003 rules for credit quality classification evolved to incorporate SP more broadly
into the classification and use the more conservative or lower rating between SP and Moodys
for index inclusion purposes35 Index user interest in an even more inclusive set of criteria and
the desire to mitigate further the reliance on a single outlier agency prompted the addition of
Fitch ratings in 2005 and the transition to the use of the middle of three ratings
Sovereign Ratings
Sovereign ratings are assigned by the rating agencies as a measure of the capacity and
commitment of central governments to repay their outstanding debt obligations Local currency
treasury and hard currency sovereign issues are classified using the middle sovereign36 rating
from Moodys Fitch and SP for all outstanding bonds even if bondlevel ratings are available37
The middle sovereign rating is applied uniformly as the index rating at the bond level across
all treasury bonds even if bondlevel ratings show as NR for one or more agencies38 This rule is
also applied in cases where issuers that are backed by a central government have ratings for
some but not all securities at the bond level To prevent split ratings for such issuers the
sovereign rating may be applied as the index rating to all bonds from that issuer39
32 The three ratings agencies used for most indices are widely accepted and followed by index users in their own credit evaluations and offer wide coverage of the
global fixed income markets
33 Prior to January 1 2011 SeriesB inflationlinked and government bond indices used the lower of the Moodys and SP ratings only The middle of the three ratings of
Moodys SP and Fitch is now used instead
34 Index user interest in the use of additional ratings agencies gained considerable momentum after credit market volatility in 2002
35 Upon implementation of this change the movement of securities out of investment grade and into high yield indices was minimal with 28 securities USD66bn by
market value dropping out of the US Aggregate Index and entering the US HY Index
36 The longterm local currency sovereign rating is used for treasury issues the longterm foreign currency sovereign rating is used for sovereign issues for all currencies
except USD and CAD For sovereign bonds denominated in USD and CAD bondlevel ratings are used
37 For example Japans sovereign rating is assigned to all Japanese government governmentguaranteed Japanese agency and local government securities
denominated in JPY Similarly all US MBS passthroughs are assigned the US government rating for all agencies even though the MBS pools themselves are not
explicitly rated
38 US Agencies are assigned the same rating as US Treasuries
39 Effective May 1 2018 if the local sovereign debt of a currency is not eligible for the Global Aggregate Index then no other securities denominated in that currency will
be eligible regardless of the securities issuelevel ratings
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 26
Credit quality may be
assigned using an expected
rating issuer rating or
sovereign rating when bondlevel ratings are unavailable
Classifications when BondLevel Ratings are Unavailable
In certain cases bondlevel ratings for indexeligible securities may not be available while other
assessments of credit quality such as expected ratings or issuerlevel ratings are The following
rules are used to assign credit quality in such situations They may be applied for shortterm
purposes where the absence of a rating may be temporary or in longerterm cases where a
rating agency only offers issuerlevel ratings not bondlevel ratings
Use of Expected Ratings
When the credit rating assigned by a rating agency is referred to as expected it generally
indicates that a rating has been assigned based on the agencys expectations of receiving final
documentation from the issuer Once the final documentation is received and reflects the
agencys expectations the expected rating is converted to a final rating Expected ratings at
issuance may be used to ensure timely index inclusion or to classify splitrated issuers properly
For example if a bond has one confirmed high yield rating and one confirmed investment
grade rating a third unconfirmed rating may be used to prevent unnecessary index turnover
between high yield and investment grade indices once the third rating is confirmed
Issuer Ratings
For unrated senior securities from issuers with other indexeligible bonds Bloomberg may
apply the issuer rating that exists on any existing senior bond For unrated subordinated
securities Bloomberg may apply the issuer subordinated rating In cases where there is no
subordinated rating subordinated bonds will be excluded from the indices In both cases the
middle issuer rating will be displayed at the security level as the index rating while the ratings
for each agency will be displayed as NR Issuer ratings are not used in cases where there are
confirmed bondlevel ratings from at least one agency
Ratings for Pfandbriefe
German Pfandbriefe are assigned ratings that are one full rating category above the issuers
unsecured debt rating
Average Quality at the Index Level
A linear numeric system is used to average the bondlevel index ratings The index rating of
each bond is assigned a numeric value from 2 to 24 and the constituents numeric ratings are
market value weighted to arrive at the aggregate average quality for the index Figure 7

Defaulted Securities
For index purposes a security is considered to be in default if it missed a scheduled interest or
principal payment has an index rating of D based on the indices credit quality methodology
or is trading flat Defaulted bonds from corporate issuers are not eligible for Bloomberg Indices
such as the US High Yield Index Once a corporate bond is identified as in default from an index
standpoint its accrued interest is set to zero reversing out any accrual posted since the last
coupon payment and it will have a negative coupon return The bond continues to be priced in
the Returns Universe until monthend at which time it will exit the index When securities
default index users will see all analytics such as duration and spread set to zero
In the case of missed payments on treasury and sovereign debt issued by central governments
debt is often restructured through a revision to the debt terms agreed upon by the government
and bond holders Due to the increased probability that sovereign debt will come out of default
through restructuring or an exchange Bloomberg allows defaulted sovereign bonds to remain
eligible for indices such as the EM USD Aggregate Index
For US municipals a bond is considered to be in default if an issuer misses a principal and or
an interest payment
Amount Outstanding
The amount outstanding or par value of a bond determines not only the notional balance on
which an issuer pays interest but the amount of principal to be repaid by an issuer at the end of
a bonds term Par amount outstanding is seen as a measure of relative liquidity and as a proxy
of the float available for investors to purchase with larger bonds viewed as more accessible
than smaller ones For purposes of inclusion Bloomberg Indices have a minimum amount
outstanding rule that is applied on a securitylevel basis This is sometimes referred to as a
minimum liquidity rule
The minimum amount outstanding size for the Global Aggregate Index US Aggregate Index
and EM Local Currency Government Index are the same40 Different minimums are used for the
High Yield InflationLinked EM Hard Currency and Municipal Index families
Minimum market size at the country level is also a consideration for flagship inflationlinked
WGILB and EM local currency indices but not a consideration for other broadbased indices
such as the US Aggregate or Global Aggregate Indices Additionally no minimum issuer size is
applied to corporate or governmentrelated issuers in standard benchmark indices41
Local currency minimums are
based on marketspecific
issuance and benchmark issue
sizes and a comparison of
Local Currency Minimums
Global Aggregate and EM Local Currency Minimum Issue Sizes
Effective April 2013 Bloomberg Indices use fixed minimum issue sizes for each local currency
bond market42 For each currency included in the Global Aggregate and EM Local Currency
Government Index families local currency minimums are established based on a number of
factors including marketspecific issuance patterns and benchmark issuance sizes and a
40 US Aggregate minimum amount outstanding was increased to match that of Global Aggregate Index on April 1 2017
41 Prior to April 2013 hard currency emerging market corporate bond issuers were subject to a USD1bn minimum issuer size constraint
42 Prior to April 2013 local currency minimums were set for nonG4 currencies by converting each currency into either USD GBP EUR or JPY based on region using
exchange rates as of the last day of November The annual process set a fixed minimum par amount outstanding for each bond in its local currency that would remain in
effect for the upcoming year starting on January 1 The fixed local currency minimums would then be reset the following November The switch to local currency
minimums eliminated annual turnover caused by annual resets of G4 pegs and set new appropriate thresholds for markets where benchmark issuance was lower or
higher than current G4 equivalents

thresholds across markets to
ensure similar size standards
comparison of existing minimum thresholds across markets to ensure similar size standards are
applied The local currency minimums are reviewed on an annual basis through Bloombergs
formal governance process to ensure an accurate representation of each market Figure 8 lists
minimum amounts outstanding for the Bloomberg Indices43
Rules for Indices with Higher Minimum Issue Sizes
Higher liquidity versions of the Global Aggregate and EM Local Currency Government Indices
use adjusted local currency minimums for each currency that are scaled up proportionally to the
same desired percentage increase This scaling factor is determined by dividing the new
desired minimum for a specific currency by its current Global Aggregate minimum which is
then applied to all currencies eligible for the benchmark
For example setting a USD or EUR minimum issue size of 500mn represents a 23 increase over
their Global Aggregate minimum issue size of 300mn This higher liquidity threshold is then
applied proportionally to all other Global Aggregate currency minimums reflecting the same
percentage increase from 300mn to 500mn The adjusted JPY minimum in this example would
be increased to JPY583bn from its current JPY35bn
Investors who prefer marketspecific local currency minimums that are not scaled proportionally
across the entire benchmark may do so in a customized index

InflationLinked Indices
The minimum issue size for inflationlinked government bonds in developed markets is higher
than their nominal counterparts in the Global Treasury Universal Index and slightly lower for
emerging markets Figure 8 For most developed markets actual issue sizes of indexeligible
government debt are substantially higher than the index minimums
US Aggregate Minimum Issue Sizes
US Aggregate minimum issue sizes have evolved to reflect the growth and size of the USDdenominated bond market and benchmark issuance sizes Figure 9
 The US Aggregate Index has a minimum issue size of USD300mn for government credit
and covered bonds as of April 1 2017
 For MBS securities the minimum generic size in the US Aggregate is USD1bn as of April
2014 previously the minimum matched the overall minimum of the US Aggregate44
 For ABS and CMBS securities the original deal size minimum is USD500mn and the eligible
tranche size minimum is USD25mn CMBS securities also must be part of a deal that has at
least USD300mn currently outstanding45

Minimum Market Size
For Bloomberg EM Local Currency Government and World Government InflationLinked
Indices eligible local currency markets are also subject to minimum market size requirements
for index inclusion based on the gross amount outstanding of debt
 To be considered for inclusion in the EM Local Currency Government Index a market must
have at least USD5bn equivalent in nominal fixedrate local currency debt at the time of the
annual review Additional reviews of market investability and accessibility are conducted
making this rule a necessary but not sufficient condition for inclusion
 To be considered for inclusion in the World Government InflationLinked Bond Index a
market must be in excess of USD4bn equivalent as of the quarterly review date end of
quarter Markets and eligible bonds must also meet all other index inclusion criteria to be
added The threshold for existing markets is lowered to USD2bn to prevent unnecessary
turnover due to shortterm fluctuations in exchange rates or issuance The existing market
minimum is assessed on an annual basis
Federal Reserve purchases
and sales of nominal and
inflationlinked US Treasuries
are reflected in flagship
indices
Float Adjustments to Amount Outstanding
US Treasuries
Federal Reserve purchases and sales of nominal and inflationlinked US Treasuries in open
market operations are adjusted in the Bloomberg flagship US Aggregate Global Treasury and
SeriesL US TIPS Indices using data made publicly available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York website48 These reports are released weekly by the Fed usually Thursdays around
430pm New York time
Adjustments to each securitys amount outstanding are made in the Projected Universe for
government purchases and sales for the Federal Reserve SOMA System Open Market Account
on a weekly basis typically on Fridays49 When US Treasury nominal or inflationlinked bonds
are issued or reopened the initial par amount outstanding that enters the Projected Universe is
reduced for any issuance bought by the Federal Reserve at auction50
46 Prior to 2014 the PanEuropean HY minimums were set as onethird of Global Aggregate minimums for each eligible currency
47 Bonds with lower issue sizes with an EM country of risk may still qualify for other Global Aggregate subcomponents such as the US Aggregate Eurodollar or 144A
Indices
48 httpswwwnewyorkfedorgmarketssomasysopenaccholdingshtml
49 Prior to May 2009 when the US Treasury increased the scale and scope of purchases in the open market for SOMA accounts float adjustments were made on a
quarterly basis using the Treasury Quarterly Bulletin which is published with a 3month lag
50 SeriesB inflationlinked indices do not adjust the notional amount outstanding of US TIPS for SOMA holdings The US TIPS component of the SeriesB WGILB Index
uses the full amount outstanding to determine index weights and does not adjust for Federal Reserve or government holdings Therefore the amount outstanding of
TIPS in the SeriesL US TIPS Index may be less than the amount outstanding of the same bond in the WGILB Index if any part of the issue was purchased by the Federal
Reserve
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 31
Float Adjustments for Other Markets
Bloomberg offers a series of FloatAdjusted Indices that adjust the par amount outstanding for
central government holdings of other asset classes51 The US Aggregate FloatAdjusted Index
adjusts for US Federal Reserve holdings of US MBS passthroughs and US agency bonds in
addition to Treasuries The FloatAdjusted PanEuropean Aggregate adjusts the amount
outstanding of Gilts for Bank of England purchases and the FloatAdjusted AsianPacific
Aggregate Index adjusts JGB par amount outstanding for Bank of Japan purchases These
adjustments to each securitys amount outstanding are made on a monthly basis in the
Projected Universe52 and are reflected in the Returns Universe in the following month
Other Amount Outstanding Eligibility Rules
Called Securities
Securities that are fully called exit the index at their call price and the entire par amount
outstanding enters the Returns Universe as cash In the case of partial calls an adjustment to the
amount outstanding is made to reflect the current debt outstanding and the bond remains in
the index so long as all index inclusion rules including the minimum amount outstanding are
met
Sinkable Bonds
For securities with a sinking fund feature a paydown return will be calculated for months in
which a sinking payment is made and the outstanding amount of the bond will be adjusted
accordingly53
Agency MBS Prepayments
As principal is paid down US MBS passthrough generics show a decrease in par amount
outstanding which is reflected on the 16th business day of each month within the indices A
paydown return is estimated for MBS generics on the first business day of each month using the
prior months paydown data and then updated on the 16th business day to reflect actual
prepayments Though a paydown return is estimated at the beginning of the month and then
revised later adjustments to amount outstanding are made only once per month on the 16th
business day Changes to amount outstanding will generally not cause generics to exit the
index as paydowns are often offset by new monthly production and generics rarely fall below
the index minimum liquidity PanEuropean and AsianPacific mortgages eligible for Bloomberg
Indices do not use the same US MBS generic cohort paydown convention for estimating
prepayments
PayinKind Securities
PaymentinKind PIK securities pay interest in the form of additional bonds54 The amount
outstanding for a PIK bond will be increased by the amount of the additional bonds distributed
to investors by the issuer and a coupon return will be recognized in the month of payment
Coupon does not accrue for these bonds in other months
Maturity
Most flagship Bloomberg Aggregate High Yield InflationLinked and Emerging Markets
Indices have a minimum remaining time to maturity55 of one year though other indices are
available that may include bonds with a maturity less than one year Within securitized indices
an average life or weighted average maturity is calculated for each security and used for the
maturity minimum For subindices Bloomberg will generally use the lower bound when setting
51 Central bank purchases of these securities are reflected in the Float Adjusted Indices
52 The monthly float adjustments are reflected in the Projected Universe usually around the 17th US business day All securities use the latest data available at the time
when float adjustments process is done except for US MBS which use Fed holdings as of the last Wednesday of the prior month
53 Excluded from Bloomberg Indices are sinkable local currency Russian OFZ bonds that were indexeligible prior to April 2014 but removed from the indices due to
liquidity reasons
54 Toggle notes are a derivative of PIK bonds that have an embedded option that allows the issuer to pay the coupon in cash or in additional securities Both toggle notes
and PIK bonds are eligible for Bloomberg Indices Bonds that are partial PIK and partial cash pay are excluded
55 Actual value of time to maturity is calculated based on the day count convention of each bond
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 32
a maturity range For example a 15 year index will generally include bonds with a maturity of
between 1 and up to but not including 5 years as of the index rebalancing date
Most flagship Bloomberg
Indices have a minimum time
to maturity or average life for
securitized bonds of one year
Index Eligibility and Classification by Maturity
Bloomberg uses time to final maturity to determine index inclusion and classify bonds by their
remaining term There is no limit on final maturity as long as the bond has a stated final
maturity Bonds with 50 and 100year maturities may be included in flagship indices but fixedrate perpetuals are not eligible
 For most government corporate and covered securities maturity is calculated on a daily
basis as the difference between the stated final maturity date and the current index
settlement date of a bond
 ABS and CMBS securities must have a remaining average life of at least one year while MBS
must have a weighted average maturity WAM of at least one year56
 Fixedtofloating rate perpetuals and fixedtovariable bonds are included in the indices until
one year prior to their conversion to floatingrate or coupon reset Their maturity date within
the indices for purposes of maturity calculation is set to the conversion date
For widely used benchmark indices the index flag will automatically be updated on the first day
of the month for securities dropping out of the Projected Universe due to their falling below the
1year minimum at some point during the month based on their stated maturity date This
allows the Projected Universe forecast to be as accurate as possible during the month by
excluding bonds that may have not yet dropped below one year on the first day of the month
rather than waiting until the exact day the bond will drop below 1 year to maturity57
Subindices by maturity are
inclusive of lower bounds
SubIndices by Maturity
For subindices by maturity Bloomberg will generally use the lower bound when setting a
maturity range Bloomberg defines intermediate indices as consisting of securities with
remaining maturities between 1 year and up to but not including 10 years Long indices
consist of securities with 10 or more years to maturity Generally indices referred to as short
contain bonds with less than 1 year to maturity
Country
When evaluating portfolio risk fixed income investors will often look at the country or
geographic region of an issuers risk as a separate consideration from the currency of the
bonds principal and interest payments This determination is used by investors when looking at
macro allocations risk budgets and concentrations across markets as well as when evaluating
the relative value of nongovernment bonds over comparable government bonds within the
same market In particular country classification is important for investors who make formal
distinctions between developed and emerging markets in their portfolios
Country designation in
Bloomberg Indices represents
country of risk
Country Classification
Bloomberg Indices use a country of risk approach to determine country classifications58 For
government governmentrelated and corporate bond issuers that are operating domiciled or
concentrated within a single market country classification is generally a straightforward
exercise For corporates or other issuers with geographically diverse operations complex
ownership structures a presence in multiple locations59 or other risk exposures that span
multiple markets country classifications are more challenging The primary criteria for
classifying country of risk are
56 MBS analytics are calculated assuming sameday settlement
57 This dynamic will not occur for maturitybased subindices where a lower or upper bound is something other than 1 year Index flags are calculated on broad flagship
benchmarks only
58 Effective end of September 2019 the Indices country of risk is sourced from Bloomberg Country of Risk CoR field However prior to September 2019 the two
country of risk designations may have differed
59 Not all bonds under a ticker will have the same country of risk The indices framework allows for wholly owned subsidiaries to have a different country of risk than the
parent company For example Credit Suisse USA Inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG The former carries a US country of risk while the latter carries a
Swiss country of risk this is determined based on where the subsidiary operates in relation to the parent entity
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 33
 Where a bonds guarantee comes from if the issuer is backed by a government or parent
corporate entity
 Where the largest source of revenue operations or cash flows is generated by the issuer
 Where an issuer is headquartered or its centralized decisionmaking occurs60
Additional criteria may be used in the evaluation of a bonds country of risk including but not
limited to
 Where the issuer is incorporated legally domiciled61 and regulated
 Where an issuers stock is listed and traded
 Where existing issuers within the index that are similarly structured or organized are
classified
Even with established criteria
country classification can
present challenges and can
change over time
Initial Issuer Country Assignment and Review
For certain large and complex issuers cases can be made for a number of different country
classifications using the criteria outlined above Furthermore even with established criteria
country classifications can change over time due to various factors A few examples of recent
country reassignments that illustrate some of these complexities include
 Petroleos Mexicanos PEMEX the Mexican stateowned petroleum company issued three
securities guaranteed by the ExportImport Bank of the United States in June 2012 To reflect
properly the guarantee these bonds hold from a US government agency their country of
risk was updated from Mexico to the United States As result the bonds fell out of the US
Credit Index and moved to the US Government Index which includes US agencies and US
Treasuries Inclusion in the flagship US Aggregate was not affected however the bonds no
longer qualified for the EM USD Aggregate Index since their country of risk was no longer
classified as an emerging market The credit rating was also updated from the PEMEX issuer
rating to the US government rating
 In March 2013 Nexen a publicly traded Canadian energy company was acquired by the
Chinese stateowned entity CNOOC Ltd with CNOOC guaranteeing Nexens outstanding
debt As a result of the acquisition and CNOOC guarantee the country of risk for the Nexen
bonds was changed from Canada to China Additionally the sector of indexeligible Nexen
bonds was updated from Industrial  Energy to GovernmentRelated  Agencies and the
ticker was updated from NXYCN to CNOOC As a result four Nexen issues became eligible
for the USD EM Aggregate Index Eligibility within the US Aggregate and US Credit Indices
was not affected
 In September 2012 the country of risk for NII Capital Corporation was updated to Brazil in
the benchmark indices to more accurately reflect the companys operational exposure
revenue sources and LATAM credit risk Due to this change three bonds exited the US High
Yield Index and entered the EM USD Aggregate Index
Index users may challenge a particular issuers country of risk and request a review if they feel
an alternative country assignment may be more appropriate for a given bond or issuer
Bloomberg looks to maintain an open dialogue with index users on country of risk
classifications within the indices given the effect such delineations can have on portfolio
allocations and management
An annually reviewed fixed list
of emerging market countries
is used to define country
eligibility in flagship EM hard
Bloomberg Indices Emerging Markets Country List
In addition to being a requirement for inclusion in Bloomberg dedicated EM Indices an
emerging markets country designation also affects inclusion in high yield indices which exclude
issuers with an EM country of risk as a rule Broadbased investment grade indices such as the
60 This is a fundamental consideration for multinational corporations and entities that have operations spanning multiple regions eg metals and mining companies
61 In many cases the country of risk and country of legal domicile can be one and the same In other cases however the two may be different based on the issuers
operations relationship with parent company subsidiaries or legal profile For example the issuers country of risk can match the country of the issuers parent instead
of its legal domicile when the bond is issued by a subsidiary that is guaranteed by the parent In other cases the country of a nonguaranteed subsidiary or other
offshore structure may depend on where the economic risk is coming from rather than the country of the subsidiarys legal domicile or parent

Market of Issue
Market of issue is used to identify whether a security is offered to domestic investors only to
foreign investors only or globally to both Placement type identifies whether a bond is publicly
registered or exempt from such registration and available broadly to institutional investors or
privately placed to a narrower set of qualified institutional investors Both attributes are used to
identify securities that may be restricted or unavailable to certain investors and therefore
ineligible for benchmark inclusion
For certain investors privately placed securities are prohibited investments due to explicit
governance and fiduciary constraints63 that limit exposure to less liquid securities Compared
with private placements publicly registered securities and those exempt from registration
require a higher level of disclosure demand additional reporting requirements and subject the
issuer to laws of the local jurisdictions in which they are registered to sell a bond This
transparency will often broaden the appeal of registered securities to a wider set of investors
including those unable to own private placements However depending on the issuers
borrowing needs they may still choose to target investors outside of their local market or issue
private placements Private placements are excluded from most flagship Aggregate Indices such
as the US Aggregate and Euro Aggregate but are measured in standalone indices such as the
US 144A Index which is a subset of the US Universal and Global Aggregate Indices
63 For example US investors with fiduciary duties governed by ERISA are generally restricted from owning private placements in their portfolios
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 38
Market of Issue Criteria
For domestic singlecurrency benchmarks such as the US Aggregate market of issue is used to
exclude securities that are offered only to foreign investors Multicurrency indices such as the
Global Aggregate which are agnostic to the domicile of the investor will often be more
inclusive of securities that may be offered outside of a domestic market
US Indices
The US Aggregate Index does not include privately placed securities or bonds that are
marketed or offered only to nonUS investors eurodollar placements Therefore the US
Aggregate includes
 Securities that have a public registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC and are subject to SEC reporting requirements64
 Debt that is exempt from registration with the SEC65
 Bonds issued under SEC Rule 144A with registration rights to convert into a public issue
The US Aggregate includes global bonds that are available in domestic and nondomestic
markets Bonds that are available to nonUS investors including global bonds that may be US
Aggregate eligible and Eurodollar bonds marketed exclusively to nonUS investors are tracked
in a separate Eurodollar Index66
US Rule 144A provides an exemption from SEC registration for the resale of previously privately
placed securities Securities resold under US Rule 144A are restricted and can generally be sold
only to Qualified Institutional Buyers QIBs Bloomberg Indices make a distinction between
bonds issued under US Rule 144A based on whether the issuer has the right to register the bond
in the future with the SEC Private placement credit bonds issued under US Rule 144A that do
not have registration rights are tracked in a separate US 144A Index which includes bonds with
and without registration rights
A security with RegS and Rule
144A tranches is treated as one
security in par value to prevent
doublecounting
Bonds with 144A and RegulationS Tranches
RegulationS under the US Securities Act of 1933 governs the offering and sale of USDdenominated bonds outside the United States Securities are often brought to market with one
tranche that adheres to RegulationS for nonUS investors and one that adheres to US Rule 144A
for US investors A security with both SEC RegulationS RegS and SEC Rule 144A tranches is
treated as one security in par value to prevent doublecounting within the Bloomberg Indices
The tranche included in the index is used to represent the issue and comprises the combined
amount outstanding of the 144A and RegS tranches
For nonemerging markets issuers the 144A tranche is selected to represent an issue with both
144A and RegS tranches For emerging markets issuers which tranche is selected depends on
whether the issuer has the option to register the bond with the SEC under US Rule 144A
 If a bond is issued with a 144A and RegS tranche and the 144A tranche has registration
rights Bloomberg will use the 144A tranche as long as the bond is eligible for one of the
investment grade indices US Aggregate Eurodollar or 144A Index In cases where a bond is
eligible for the hard currency emerging markets indices only eg high yield or nonrated
bonds Bloomberg will use the RegS tranche
 If a bond is issued with a 144A and RegS tranche and the 144A tranche does not have
registration rights the RegS tranche is used for index purposes
If a bond enters the indices as nonEM and then later becomes eligible for an EM index the
tranche used for index purposes will not change67 Broader benchmarks such as the US
64 If an issue is registered with the SEC and the issuer later deregisters the bond it will not affect index eligibility
65 For example bank debt issued under Rule 3a2 is exempt from registration with the SEC
66 To be included in the EM USD Aggregate Index and US Universal Index Eurodollaronly securities were previously subject to a 41day seasoning rule which
corresponds to the regulatory waiting period between issuance and when US investors can enter the Eurodollar market As of July 1 2013 the seasoning rule was
removed as an inclusion criterion of the EM USD Aggregate Index but continues to be applied to the US Universal Index a core plus benchmark used primarily by USbased investors
67 For example 144A Chile bonds that were added to the indices before Chile was added to the EM country list in April 2013 continue to use the 144A tranche for index
purposes The rule of using of the same tranche when the bond changes from EM to DM and vice versa applies to all indices
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 39
Universal and Global Aggregate Indices do not make the same distinction for market of issue
since they assume that the investor is either an unconstrained core plus user US Universal or a
global investor Global Aggregate who would regularly invest in these markets Therefore USDdenominated bonds in the 144A and Eurodollar Indices that are not already in the US Aggregate
will be eligible for these broader benchmarks
Exchanges
Securities that are originated under US Rule 144A with registration rights and later registered
with the SEC are treated as the same security for index purposes Once the registered identifier
becomes available it is used in the index Typically index users will use a bonds ticker coupon
and maturity date to link the 144A identifier with the new SECregistered identifier The only
change they will notice is an update to the identifier and Placement Type it will not look as
though the 144A bond exited the index and the SECregistered bond entered it
Other Regional Aggregate Indices
Rules on public versus private placements apply to other nonUS aggregate benchmarks as
well68 Debt that is offered publicly to domestic investors or globally marketed is aggregate
index eligible but there is no equivalent distinction for US Rule 144A bonds with registration
rights within PanEuropean or AsianPacific indices
Bonds that are marketed primarily to retail investors even if an institution could buy them are
excluded from the aggregate indices Screening for an exclusion of retail bonds and private
placements is an ongoing process that looks at a variety of factors The first phase of the process
is to assess all new bonds that appear eligible for the indices All bonds are given a score based
on several factors including but not limited to
 Minimum piece or increment
 Number of available price quotes from brokerdealers
 Number of lead managers
 Whether the coupon and issue size are conventional or plain vanilla69
If a bond is given a score that is indicative of a retail bond the issuer is contacted to verify the
nature of the bond If no confirmation is received from the issuer and the bond does not meet
the requisite score it is excluded from the index If new evidence to the contrary comes to light
following the bonds initial exclusion it may subsequently be added
Taxability
Bloomberg index eligibility rules consider a bonds taxability from both an issuer and an investor
perspective
From an issuer perspective taxability of coupondividend payments is used to distinguish
between debt and equity and therefore whether a security will qualify for Bloomberg fixed
income indices Interest payments must be made on a pretax basis by the issuer for a security to
be fixed income index eligible Payments made on an aftertax basis are considered dividends
and the instruments are classified as preferred equity and therefore not benchmark index
eligible
From an investor perspective Bloomberg distinguishes between taxexempt securities notably
the US municipal market and bonds that are taxable for the end investor To be eligible for
flagship indices such as the US Aggregate or Global Aggregate Indices interest payments must
be fully taxable to the investor The taxexempt US municipal bond market is tracked in a
standalone family of indices
68 Eg effective December 2019 a security needs to be placed with at least 10 institutional investors at issuance to be referred to as widely distributed and to be eligible
for the Canada Aggregate Indices
69 Retail bonds are often issued with a very specific coupon andor issue sizes that are typically not round numbers
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 40
Bloomberg does not make any
tax assumptions or adjustments
when calculating flagship index
returns
For flagship indices Bloomberg does not calculate index returns on a net basis and published
levels are gross of any applicable taxes capital gains withholding stamp capital controls etc
to the end investor Tax liabilities are an investorspecific determination especially in cases
where crosscountry tax treaties onshore versus offshore investor access and other
considerations vary from fund to fund and from firm to firm70
Taxability of Debt versus Equity
From an issuer perspective interest payments must be made on a gross basis for a security to
be fixed income index eligible Payments made on a net basis are considered dividends and the
instruments are classified as preferred equity and therefore not eligible for fixed income
indices This distinction arises mainly for hybrid capital securities that have both debt and
equitylike characteristics This rule therefore excludes preferred shares that pay a fixed coupon
without a final maturity dividendsreceived deduction DRD securities and qualified dividend
income QDI securities from the indices
Taxable versus TaxExempt Bonds
Because most US municipal securities are taxexempt issuers can borrow at lower rates while
offering investors a taxequivalent return that may be comparable to a higher coupon taxable
bond This tax exemption is something that segments the potential investor base as not all
investors may receive the same tax benefits from this market Therefore Bloomberg Indices
make a clear distinction between taxexempt municipals in standalone municipal indices and
other taxable bonds in flagship indices
Not all US municipal debt is taxexempt and the exclusion of taxexempt municipals is not an
issuerbased exclusion Taxable municipal bonds have been eligible for the US Aggregate Index
since 2003 These securities are classified within the Local Authority sector and qualify for the
US Credit Index
Build America Bonds BAB
Taxable municipal securities issued under the Build America Bond program are one type of
taxable security eligible for the US Aggregate Index as long as the issuer opts to receive a direct
subsidy payment from the federal government reimbursing a portion of the interest costs In this
case Build America Bonds are fully taxable to the investor and treated like other US Aggregate
eligible taxable municipals with respect to inclusion and sector classification BABs issued with
the tax credit going to the investor are not index eligible
Calculation of Index Returns
While the discussion of endinvestor tax liabilities has focused on US municipals global investors
are often subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions depending on the applicable tax laws in
each market and whether the end investor is domestic or foreign For all indices including
Municipal Indices Bloomberg does not make any tax assumptions or adjustments withholding
taxes on interest income capital gains taxes stamp taxes etc since these are unique to
individual investors based on a variety of factors including where the investor has local market
operations or reciprocal tax treaties with their home market Though flagship index returns are
calculated gross of taxes Bloomberg has published netoftax index returns in bespoke indices
upon client request
Subordination
In the case of default the capital structure of an issuers outstanding debt determines the order
in which creditors are paid back Holders of debt secured by specified or ringfenced assets are
generally paid back first followed by senior unsecured bondholders Subordinated securities
70 Net of taxes may be calculated on a customized basis but net indices account only for withholding taxes
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 41
which rank below secured and senior bonds generally have a different risk profile than that of
securities with more senior claims on an issuers assets this additional risk is reflected in a
securitys price Naturally investors often look at where a bond falls within an issuers capital
structure when making investment decisions with the most important distinction between senior
debt and subordinated debt including hybrid capital
Secured Bonds
In the event of a default holders of secured debt which is backed by dedicated collateral that
can be sold to repay bondholders rank highest among an issuers creditors followed by senior
unsecured debt holders Figure 13 lists subordination classifications for secured credit bonds
within Bloomberg Indices
Figure 13

Subordination Type Index Code Description
First Mortgage Bond 1STMTG
A security with the first mortgage on the issuers property

A type of passthrough security commonly used in aircraft
finance in the US In the transaction a trust certificate is
sold to investors to finance the purchase of an aircraft by
a trust which then leases the aircraft to the airline and
the trustee passes payment through the trust to the
investors Holders of certificates have first claim on those
assets
First General and
Refunding Mortgage
Bonds
GENREF
A bond secured by a first general mortgage or a
refunding mortgage a mortgage loan that is refinanced
with another loan
Senior Debt
Of an issuers outstanding bonds senior unsecured debt is considered lower risk than
subordinated debt Although senior debt holders must be repaid before other unsecured
creditors in a bankruptcy event the securities are backed only by the credit of the issuer and its
ability to service the debt
Senior unsecured credit bonds are assigned a subordination type of Debentures Notes Senior
Senior Debentures or Senior Notes within Bloomberg Indices71 Investors looking for a
customized benchmark that includes senior unsecured debt only will generally construct their
index using the aforementioned values of the subordination type data attribute
Subordinated Debt
Subordinated bonds typically carry lower credit ratings and offer a higher spread than more
senior ranked bonds in the capital structure to compensate investors for the additional risk they
carry Within the benchmark indices Bloomberg distinguishes between subordinated bonds or
debentures and capital securities Subordinated bonds that are not considered capital securities
by Bloomberg are assigned values of Subordinated Subordinated Debentures Junior
Subordinated Debentures or Senior Subordinated Debentures in the subordination type
71 Subordination type is a relevant attribute for credit bonds only Although securitized bonds are assigned a senior value this attribute is not meant to represent where
a specific tranche ranks within a given securitized deal
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 42
attribute Capital securities on the other hand are identified with a subordination type of either
Tier 1 Upper Tier 2 Lower Tier 2 or Capital Credit
For index purposes capital
securities are deeply
subordinated instruments that
qualify as regulatory capital or
receive quasiequity credit from
the rating agencies
Capital Securities
For index purposes capital securities are deeply subordinated fixed income securities that
qualify for treatment as regulatory capital by regulators or receive quasiequity credit from the
rating agencies Bloomberg publishes a Global Capital Securities Index to track the market for
these bonds which also qualify for the flagship aggregate and high yield indices depending on
their credit quality While also considered capital securities bonds identified as contingent
capital are excluded as a rule from Bloomberg aggregate and high yield indices but are tracked
in a standalone Global Contingent Capital Index
Types of hybrid capital instruments included in capital securities indices include
 Tier 1 T1 bonds that are deeply subordinated securities senior only to equity and have
coupon deferral features both optional and mandatory without incurring a default event
Common characteristics of traditional T1 instruments generally include
 Perpetual but callable
 No contractual obligation to pay dividends or interest to T1 bondholders with the
deferral of a coupon usually being at the option of the issuer
 Deferred coupons are noncumulative
 T1 should be able to absorb losses before or instead of general creditors
 Upper Tier 2 UT2 UT2 securities are longdated or perpetual callable bonds with
interest deferral features that allow the issuer at its own option to defer payment under
specific circumstances such as falling below capital adequacy requirements Interest
payments on UT2 securities are cumulative eg payments have to be made up at a later
date and interest on interest is normally payable in the event of deferral
 Lower Tier 2 LT2 dated securities whose coupons are not deferrable without triggering
a default LT2 bonds have a minimum maturity of five years and often have interest stepups
and calls five years prior to maturity72
 Capital Credit CCRDT hybrid capital securities issued by various types of nonbank
entities are classified as capital credit Issues are primarily from US or European insurance
companies73 with structures among nonbank issuers varying greatly Security claims tend to
be on parity with junior subordinated debt or preferred shares and are longdated or
perpetual Typically these securities include some form of coupon deferral
Benchmark Index Rebalancing Rules
Most Bloomberg benchmark indices are rebalanced monthly offering intramonth stability in
index composition74 Securities that meet all published index inclusion rules and eligibility
criteria at the beginning of a given month will remain in the index for purposes of return
calculations until the following monthend when index composition is next reset
Unlike the rebalancing of equity indices which occurs less often the monthly rebalancing of
Bloomberg Indices better suits the more frequent issuance and the more dynamic borrowing
needs of fixed income issuers
This section will describe the mechanics of the monthly rebalance process
72 Effective September 7 2017 subordination classification of Senior NonPreferred debt changed to Senior from Lower Tier 2 LT2
73 Insurance companies usually issue capital securities to get regulatory capital treatment while industrial and utility companies do so to get quasiequity credit from the
rating agencies
74 Certain tradable bond indices may rebalance less frequently on either a semiannual or an annual basis In addition alternative weight benchmarks such as GDP
Weighted indices and Fiscal Strength Weighted indices have countrylevel weights or scores that are updated annually but still rebalance monthly to reflect changes in
the eligible security universes
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 43
Two universes of securities are
maintained for each Bloomberg
index a fixed Returns Universe
and a dynamic Projected
Universe
Benchmark Returns and Projected Universes
For each Bloomberg index two universes of securities are maintained one that is held constant
throughout the month from the previous index rebalancing date and one that changes daily to
reflect the latest composition of the market since the last rebalancing The former the Returns
Universe also referred to as the backwards universe is a static set of securities that is
determined at the beginning of each month and is not reset until the beginning of the next
month This fixed universe is used to calculate daily and monthly index returns and is the basket
of bonds based on which index users are officially measured against The Returns Universe is
not adjusted for securities that become ineligible for the index during the month eg due to
ratings downgrades called bonds securities falling below one year to maturity or for issues that
are newly eligible eg ratings changes new issuance Because the Returns Universe is held
constant throughout the month fund managers avoid having to hit a moving target
The Projected Forward Universe is a dynamic set of bonds that changes daily to reflect the
latest set of indexeligible securities As an uptodate projection of the next months Returns
Universe the Projected Universe assists active managers by providing them with the necessary
insight to modify their portfolios ahead of any index changes and assists passive managers by
preparing them for any executions needed ahead of monthly rebalancing Indicative changes to
securities are reflected daily in both the Projected and Returns Universes of the index and may
cause bonds to enter or fall out of the Projected Universe but will affect the composition of the
Returns Universe only at monthend The examples below illustrate how several transactions are
treated in the Returns and Projected Universes over the course of a month
1 Returns and Projected Universe Dynamics Sample Movements
 XYZ Company 45 of 3152021 is a developed market bond with USD500mn amount
outstanding that meets all criteria for the US Corporate Investment Grade Index as of May
31 On June 4 the bond is downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3
 This bond will continue to contribute to returns for the duration of June even though it is
now rated below investment grade
 The bond will drop from the Projected Universe after the downgrade because it is below
investment grade and will not be eligible for the benchmark when it is next rebalanced at
monthend This bond will therefore be excluded from indexlevel analytics aggregations
that are published in the Projected Universe
 The downgraded bond will enter the US Corporate High Yield Index Projected Universe
once it drops from the US Corporate Investment Grade Index
2 ABC Company 2875 of 1152027 meets all index criteria when it is issued on June 15
 This bond will not contribute to returns reported for the month of June
 The bond will enter the Projected Universe for June assuming all security reference
information and pricing are available
3 US Treasury 1875 of 6302024 was issued months ago and has several years to maturity
on September 15
 This bond will be included in both the Returns and Projected Universes for September
4 RST Company 3750 of 6302017 meets all criteria for the US Corporate Investment Grade
Index on May 31 2016
 This bond will contribute to the Returns Universe until June monthend
 Because the maturity is known with certainty the bond will fall out of the Projected
Universe on the first day of June
 All flagship benchmarks with a 1 year minimum to maturity will automatically exclude
bonds that are expected to drop below 1 year with certainty during the month as of the
first business day to provide as early a forecast of index composition as possible
5 LMN Company 6750 of 8152017 is called on April 15 2016
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 44
 This bond contributes to returns for April The ending price is the call price
 This bond will drop out of the Projected Universe as of the call date
Index flags consolidate a
number of common eligibility
criteria into a single attribute
Bloomberg Index Flags
For many flagship Bloomberg Indices a composite index flag is calculated and published on a
daily basis which identifies whether a security meets the eligibility criteria of a particular index
with a single attribute75 76
Index flags are valuable for a number of reasons First they simplify the identification of indexeligible securities within a large data set and enable an index user to design more granular or
customized indices in a streamlined fashion Most published subindices use an existing index
flag for a particular benchmark family and then apply additional constraints to narrow or
segment the investment universe further
Second bondlevel index flags allow investors to easily identify crossover exposure within other
benchmark index families because they are not mutually exclusive For example an investor
seeking to identify the portion of the Global Aggregate Index that is also eligible for the EM
Local Currency Government Index can do so using index flags rather than replicating a long set
of eligibility criteria to filter the universes
Finally index flags enable timely benchmark turnover analysis by giving daily projections of
expected index composition as of the next rebalancing date This is done by simultaneously
identifying whether a security is eligible for an index as of a particular date and whether it was
eligible as of the last index rebalancing From this information an index user can identify
leavers joiners and continuing issues for a benchmark index Details on the mechanics of index
flags can be found in the section Benchmark Index Rebalancing

Index flags will have one of four values that identify whether a security should be included in the
Returns or Projected Universe of a given benchmark
 BOTHIND An index flag value of BOTHIND identifies a security as having been index
eligible at the beginning of the month and as of the current date It is therefore a contributor
to both the Returns and Projected Universes of a given flagship index Area B within Figure
14
 FORWARD An index flag value of FORWARD identifies a security as having not been index
eligible at the beginning of the month but eligible as of the current intramonth date The
bond is therefore a contributor only to the Projected Universe of a given flagship index and
will contribute to index returns only after the next index rebalancing Area C within Figure
14 Bonds with a FORWARD flag may include new issues or existing issues that newly qualify
for a specific index For example an existing bond that is downgraded below investment
75 Although index flags encompass many of the core attributes discussed in the previous section through a single data field there may be other index eligibility criteria
embedded in a derived index flag value
76 Index flags are available only on SeriesL benchmarks SeriesB benchmarks publish constituents on the equivalent of a Returns Universe only but a separate Forward
Index Report FIR is available for major indices such as the WGILB Index to offer a projection of index composition as of the next index rebalancing
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 45
grade may have the FORWARD index flag for a high yield benchmark if it meets all other
index inclusion rules after the ratings change and a BACKWARDS flag for the investment
grade index it is departing
 BACKWARDS An index flag value of BACKWARDS identifies a security as having been
index eligible at the beginning of the month but now not eligible as of the current intramonth date It will exit the index and is therefore a contributor only to the Returns Universe of
a given flagship index Area A within Figure 14 and not the Projected Universe
 NOTIND An index flag value of NOTIND identifies a security as having not been index
eligible at the beginning of the month and also as of the current date because it does not
satisfy all of the required index eligibility criteria
Index flags are a direct input to
the creation of published subindices by sector maturity
credit quality etc
Index flags are available only for broadbased indices and are a direct input to the creation of
published subindices by sector maturity credit quality etc When defining narrower subsets of
flagship indices bonds may enter or exit the Returns or Projected Universes without a change in
the index flag which only identifies eligibility at the broad index level Consider for example a
security that begins the month with a maturity just over 10 years that drops below 10 years to
maturity during the month It will move from the Projected Universe of a Long subindex which
contains bonds with at least 10 years to maturity to an Intermediate subindex which contains
bonds with 110 years to maturity of that benchmark because of the maturity rule but the index
flag will remain BOTHIND

Index Turnover
Index turnover is an estimate of gross index composition shift measured by the market value of
securities entering and exiting an index as a percentage of the indexs beginning market value
Expected monthly turnover occurs from the regular issuance and borrowing patterns of indexeligible issuers as bonds exit and enter an index When index rules changes are implemented

there may also be onetime turnover as securities enter an index or formerly indexeligible
bonds are dropped under the new guidelines The Projected Universe of any benchmark
reflects the net effect of any additions and drops on index composition on a daily basis and
forecasts what the index composition would be if the index were reset at that specific date
Understanding the sources of turnover entails understanding an indexs specific rules for
eligibility With objective rules in place a bond will either be indexeligible or not eligible at the
time of a monthly rebalance Any issue whose eligibility status has changed since the previous
monthend will contribute to turnover by either exiting or entering the index These issues can
be divided into two classes drops and additions77
Drops Issues Exiting an Index
Issues that are no longer indexeligible can be referred to as drops when quantifying index
turnover An issue is dropped from an index under two circumstances 1 it no longer meets the
rules for inclusion or 2 its security status has changed called or exchanged and it no longer
exists in its current form
All Bloomberg Indices have formal rules on amount outstanding minimums time to maturity and
credit rating which together are the most common sources of rulesbased drops The other
main reason for an issue to exit an index is that its status has changed and the security no longer
exists in its current CUSIP or ISIN In cases where a security enters an index and is later identified
as a retail bond or privately placed security it will be dropped from the index in light of the new
information
Additions Issues Entering an Index
Most issues that enter the Bloomberg Indices are newly issued instruments Other additions
include issues that have been upgraded to investment grade from high yield or vice versa and
bonds with a change to indicative data such as country of risk or sector Despite these other
sources of turnover new issuance accounts for most of the index additions to broadbased
benchmark indices
For the US Aggregate Index new monthly production of MBS pools will not have their own
unique identifier unless a given MBS generic78 is entering the index for the first time after
meeting the USD1bn minimum threshold Since the index uses generic identifiers based on
program coupon and vintage in its construction new pool issuance will be reflected as an
increase in par amount outstanding of existing MBS generics
New securities can also enter the indices based on rules changes These additions create a onetime increase in index turnover when they enter the index Examples of recent additions include
countries that were added to the emerging markets indices in April 2013 and inclusion of HUFdenominated debt in the Global Aggregate and Global Treasury Indices in April 2017
Gross Index Turnover
The combined sum of bonds leaving and joining the index equals gross index turnover defined
in the formula below as MVDrops and MVAdditions Since the index composition and beginning
market values used in the denominator change monthly monthly turnover percentages are
summed to estimate an annual index turnover

77 For more narrowly defined subindices turnover can occur when securities cross over from one bucket to another even if there is no turnover within the broader
benchmark For example a bond whose time to maturity drops below 10 years to maturity would not contribute to the turnover of a broadbased index but would be
considered both an addition to sub 10 year maturity indices and a drop from 10 year maturity indices to other narrower maturity based subindices
78 The Bloomberg US MBS Index is constructed by grouping individual MBS pools with the same program coupon and vintage into a generic aggregate with its own
unique eightcharacter generic CUSIP Each generic as they are typically referred to within the context of the indices is a proxy for all of the outstanding eligible
pools for a given program coupon and origination year Beginning July 2019 Freddie generics are further separated into 45 and 55day delay securities to reflect
UMBS initiative The identifiers for MBS generics are not street CUSIPs or identifiers but rather proprietary constructs of Bloomberg MBS methodology

Treatment of Cash
The timing and treatment of cash in Bloomberg Indices is an important consideration for index
users who are managing against the indices actively or passively since it affects decisions
concerning intramonth cash reinvestment and monthend rebalancing within their portfolios
Cash that has accrued within the
Returns Universe intramonth
earns no reinvestment return
Effect of Cash on the Returns Universe
Cash that has accrued within the Returns Universe intramonth earns no reinvestment return79
The events that cause cash to enter the index coupon and principal payments are accounted
for in monthly total returns calculations as coupon or paydown return but the cash itself does
not generate its own partial month return for the period it resides in the Returns Universe
Because the indices are constructed as a rulesbased basket of bonds and not treated as a
portfolio accumulated cash is stripped out of the index at monthend and effectively reinvested
pro rata across the entire index for cumulative returns purposes80
When calculating cumulative returns over periods longer than one month index cash as
captured in coupon and paydown return is implicitly reinvested back into the Returns Universe
to calculate an accurate since inception total return that reflects compounding
For indices that rebalance less frequently cash is still reinvested pro rata at end of each month
and cumulative returns over periods longer than one month still reflect monthly compounding
Duration extension quantifies
the instant index duration
change that occurs when index
membership is reset each
monthend
Duration Extension
Duration extension quantifies the instant index duration change that occurs when index
membership is reset each monthend It accounts for monthly index turnover but also factors in
the outflow of accumulated cash as the index is reset The duration metric used for purposes of
duration extension is option adjusted duration OAD for US indices and ISMA option adjusted
duration81 for nonUS indices
Returns Universe Duration vs Projected Universe Duration
For both the Returns and Projected Universes an indexlevel duration figure is published as an
aggregation of bondlevel durations of each universes indexeligible securities Differences
between these two indexlevel metrics reflects projected changes to index composition
turnover reflected in the Projected Universe and the amount of cash earned by the index from
coupon and principal accumulated in the Returns Universe
Because the Projected Universe duration is not adjusted for cash each bond is weighted by its
current market value to derive the indexlevel Projected Universe duration The bonds
contributing to the Projected duration may change daily as they enter and exit the projected
index Additionally the contribution of each bond to indexlevel duration may change as calls
taps and new issuance specifically in the case of MBS generics are reflected in each bonds
amount outstanding Price movements also affect a bonds contribution to indexlevel duration
Returns Universe duration is calculated the same way as Projected duration but is adjusted
downward for the amount of cash each security has accumulated at a zero duration The
adjustment is done using the market value for each bond within the Returns Universe RU Market
Value which contains two components
79 Starting on January 1 2011 SeriesB indices total return calculations were made consistent with SeriesL total return calculations in terms of cash treatment From July 1
2006 through December 31 2010 income from coupon and principal payments in the case of amortizing bonds was held as cash and accrued on a monthly reinvestment rate until the next rebalancing date when it was reinvested in the index Prior to July 1 2006 income from coupon payments was reinvested in the index as
soon as it was received
80 For SeriesB indices the mechanics are slightly different though cumulative return calculations are effectively identical Cash that has been earned by the index intramonth also earns no reinvestment return but the cumulative cash balance at the security level is recorded as Cash Held for return calculations which are done by
tracking the index market value over time This cash held balance is reset annually
81 ISMA International Securities Market Association duration measures the price sensitivity to changes in ISMA yield to maturity which assumes annual coupon
payments Semiannual coupons are assumed for US yield and duration calculations
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 48
1 RU Security Market Value The market value of the underlying security
2 RU Cash Market Value The amount of accumulated cash
To adjust a securitys contribution to indexlevel duration for cash its RU Security Market Value is
divided by the total RU Market Value of all the bonds in the Returns Universe to arrive at the
indexlevel figure The scaling in weighting will always be less than or equal to 100 depending
on whether a security has earned any cash during the month If no cash has been earned the
cash scaling factor will be one and the securitys contribution to Returns duration and Projected
duration will be the same
Duration Extension Methodology
At the close of the last business day of each month the Bloomberg Indices are reset and bonds
formally enter and exit the index while cash that has accumulated in the Returns Universe
during the month is removed At this moment the Projected Universe has become the next
months Returns Universe and the realized duration extension is simply the difference in the endofmonth Returns and Projected durations At monthend the extension is known with certainty
and easily derived by comparing the duration of the two published universes
There is usually a lengthening of an indexs duration each month due to cash and bonds that are
being dropped from the index often having lower durations than the bonds that remain in or
enter an index Occasionally there is a duration shortening when the opposite is true bonds
exiting the index have higher durations than the residual index In either case passive
managers must therefore react to this change and lengthen shorten their duration exposure
accordingly each month to remain duration neutral
Accessing Duration Extension Estimates
Actual duration extensions can be easily obtained by taking the difference between the Returns
Universe and Projected Universe duration of an index at monthend Prior to monthend
Bloomberg publishes periodic index duration extension estimates using forecasted turnover
and cash estimates These projections appear in Summary of Index Duration Changes and in
Benchmark Index Duration Extension  Rebalancing Forecast reports available on INPGO the
Index Publications page on the Bloomberg Terminal
All securities are assumed to
settle on a T1 calendar day
basis except for US MBS
Other Index Rebalancing Mechanics
Settlement Assumptions
For index purposes securities are assumed to settle on a T1 calendar day basis82 except for US
MBS passthroughs which assume sameday T0 settlement
On the last business day of each month the index settlement date is assumed to be the first
calendar day of the following month even if the last business day is not the last calendar day of
the month83 This allows for one full month of accrued interest to be calculated84 The only
exception is the US MBS Index for which endofmonth index returns are calculated assuming
that the trade date and the settlement date are the last calendar date of the month
SeriesB Index Settlement Assumptions
SeriesB inflationlinked and nominal government bond indices assume local market settlement
conventions and holiday calendars which vary from market to market ranging from T1
business days to T3 business days for certain linker markets Because this index family uses
different conventions an index user may see a different accrued interest value or index ratio
calculated for the same security in a SeriesB versus a SeriesL index85
82 Using a T1 calendar day settlement assumption intramonth means that accrued interest as of a Friday business day will not include accrued interest for the weekend
Accrual for the weekend will be reflected on the first business day after the weekend
83 This applies to both SeriesL and SeriesB indices
84 Cash is therefore recognized by the index on the last calendar day before the coupon record date For example if a coupon record date is the first of the month cash
will be recognized in the Returns Universe on the last day of the previous month under this settlement assumption This is a common question from index users in
particular when a security coupon date is close to a monthend but the settlementpayment date occurs in the ensuing month
85 This question often comes up when comparing US TIPS securities that trade on a T1 business day basis On a Friday or the last business day of the month the
settlement assumption may extend further than the next calendar day assumed by the T1 calendar methodology SeriesL US TIPS bonds settle on a T1 calendar day

ExDividend Conventions
The exdividend date is the first date on which the holder of a bond is not entitled to receive the
next interest payment Securities in certain markets such as the UK Gilt market trade with exdividend dates and the accrued interest of affected securities will reflect the appropriate
conventions of a given market Index users will see the accrued interest of a bond show as
negative once it starts trading exdividend and the expected coupon payment discounted back
to the current index settlement day in Returns Universe calculations
The Bloomberg Indices employ
a regional approach for index
holiday schedules
Holiday Calendars
The Bloomberg Indices employ a regional approach for index holiday schedules as opposed to
using a single holiday calendar for all indices or basing production on the calendars of each of
the 39 currencies currently represented by the indices The regional holiday calendar followed
by each currency covered in the indices can be found in Figure 15 Singlecurrency indices are
not produced if the calendar that currency follows is on holiday Publication of multicurrency
global and regional indices that include bonds following different holiday calendars is discussed
in the following sections
Publication of Global Indices
Multicurrency indices such as the Global Aggregate Index are generated every business day of
the year except for New Years Day the only holiday shared by all regional calendars During
other regional holidays global indices are still generated but use prices from the previous
business day for markets on holiday On July 4 for example the US Aggregate Index is not
produced because the US holiday calendar observes Independence Day USDdenominated
bonds in the Global Aggregate Index which is still produced show a price from the previous
business day
Publication of Regional Indices
Regional multicurrency indices that share more than one holiday calendar such as the AsianPacific Aggregate Index are generated as long as any market followed by one of the eligible
currencies is open86 In these cases the price from the previous business day for markets on
holiday is used and total returns of the indices still include currency returns from updated FX
rates and coupon return from accrued interest being generated For example if Singapore is
observing a bank holiday SGDdenominated bonds as well as any currencies not on holiday
but following the Singaporean calendar MYR THB IDR and PHP will still contribute to the AsiaPacific Aggregate published for that day but with no price performance since their prices will be
carried forward unchanged from the previous Singaporean business day

86 On July 1 2011 four additional Asian bond market calendars Australia Hong Kong South Korea and Singapore joined the Japanese calendar to determine the index
publication schedule for the AsianPacific Aggregate Indices Additionally the publication schedule for AsianPacific currencies in the EM Local Currency Indices added
three Asian bond market calendars Hong Kong South Korea and Singapore The AsianPacific Aggregate and EM Local Currency Government Indices were previously
published based on Japanese market holidays only with the exception of China and India which already used their own regional calendars
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 50
In most cases the EMEA region follows the UK holiday calendar However if the last business
day of the month is a UK holiday prices may be updated for nonGBPdenominated bonds if the
European markets are open In such cases prices from the previous day are rolled over for GBPdenominated bonds observing the UK holiday for monthend
SeriesB Indices Holiday Schedule
SeriesB indices are published every calendar day On days in which a particular market is
closed prices and analytics from the previous business day are rolled forward on that day
Timing of New Issues
Qualifying securities issued but not necessarily settled on or before the monthend rebalancing
date will qualify for inclusion in the following months index provided the required securitys
reference information and pricing are readily availability87
Inclusion of When Issued US Treasuries
US Treasuries are added to the Projected Universes of the US Aggregate and US Treasury
Indices with an assumed coupon on the announcement date if auctioned in the same month
The coupon is then updated on the auction date If US Treasuries are not auctioned in the same
month as when they are announced they are added to the Projected Universe of the indices in
the month they are auctioned
Rebalancing Details for Other Indices
Certain bespoke alternate weight and tradable indices rebalance at a set time each year
Fiscal Strength and GDP Weighted Indices
For the Fiscal Strength Weighted Index family country scores for the following year are
published in early November reflected in the November Forward Projected Universe and take
effect as of the annual rebalancing date on December 1
GDP weights are announced in early October reflected in the November Forward Projected
Universe and take effect as of the annual rebalancing date on December 1 Monthly rebalancing
occurs for underlying bonds entering and exiting the specific country subindices used by these
benchmarks
EM Tradable Indices
Most EM tradable indices will rebalance on a semiannual or an annual basis These were explicit
design features to minimize turnover in these benchmarks
Benchmark Index Pricing and Analytics
87 Fungible bonds that will funge within two months from issue are not eligible for indices Funge amount is included in existing bond when funge
After identifying an eligible universe of securities using a rulesbased set of inclusion criteria an
index provider must then accurately measure the daily return and risk characteristics of these
bonds for benchmark index users
Analytics for indexeligible securities provide investors with the necessary tools to assess the
riskiness of bonds within their investment choice set and make relative value decisions within
their portfolios With an under or overweight to their benchmark in duration or spread for
example an investor is also able to express views within their portfolio on the market
environment eg rates will rise or achieve specific objectives of their mandate eg minimize
risk

The following section provides an overview of the indices pricing methodology and the key
analytics calculated for securities in the fixed income benchmarks
Benchmark Index Pricing
In pricing the benchmark indices Bloomberg aims to mark each bond with an appropriate and
observable level when available whether sourced internally or supplied by a thirdparty pricing
vendor88 In addition to pricing sources other pricing considerations quote side settlement
and timing are important as they often provide the basis for relating an index price with levels
observed in the market
This section offers a highlevel overview of the pricing process and conventions used for
Bloomberg benchmark indices For additional details on asset classes and regions please see
Appendix 4 Pricing Methodology for the Bloomberg Indices
Pricing Sources
Independent and transparent pricing is an important part of Bloombergs index family Rather
than relying on singledealer pricing or composite pricing across a small number of dealers the
primary pricing source of bonds in Bloomberg s Indices is BVAL BVAL provides credible
transparent and defensible valuations across a broad spectrum of financial instruments
including fixed income derivatives and structured notes These prices are independent drawing
on numerous sources relevant to the market This broad global dataset of market observations is
combined with analytics to produce objective pricing with transparency into how the prices are
derived As of the publication date of this document the only Bloomberg index families not
priced by BVAL are CHFdenominated bonds which use SIX Swiss Exchange and JPY
Corporates which use Japan Securities Dealers Association aka JSDA If any of the pricing
sources were to fail to generate a securitys price the security will be priced using information
from the last index publication date
Details regarding BVALs pricing methodologies including the use of extrapolation techniques
in creating such input data are available at BVLI Go on the Terminal
Pricing Verification
A dedicated index pricing team validates the quality of index pricing daily including review of
possible outliers resulting from the verification process Index users may also challenge price
levels which are then reviewed by the pricing team If a discrepancy arises the team works with
BVAL and may adjust prices on a going forward basis
For inquiries regarding access to BVAL prices and methodologies please contact the BVAL
team at BVALbloombergnet For any other questions please contact your regional index team
or email indexpricingbloombergnet
Pricing Quote Conventions
Most indexeligible securities are quoted as a percentage of par Some inflationlinked bonds
use Real or Native yield as a direct input
Most securities are also quoted on the bid side with the exception of inflationlinked securities
and EUR GBP and JPYdenominated nominal treasuries which are priced on the mid side and
new corporates89 entering the index on the offer side in the first month
Bid pricing values a bond at the level where an investor would be able to sell it as of the index
pricing date and is a convention used by many investors for fair value accounting and reporting
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 52
90 An illustration of the one price concept is when a bond marked on the bid side in an investment grade index is downgraded to below investment grade status and
enters a high yield index still at the bid price not at the offer price
91 GCC is defined as Qatar Bahrain UAE Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Oman
Mid side pricing values securities halfway between the bid and offer price to reflect the fair value
of a bond that is agnostic to whether it is being bought or sold It is generally prudent for
markets with liquidity extremes highly liquid markets where bidmid spreads are very narrow or
highly illiquid ones such as emerging markets linkers where daily bidmid spreads may be
difficult to determine due to a lack of secondary market activity Within the indices EUR GBP
and JPY government bonds are quoted on the mid side not only because they typically have
very narrow bidmid spreads but also because this is the market convention
While different markets or asset classes represented in Bloomberg benchmark indices may be
quoted using different conventions we maintain the concept of one price for index bonds In
other words each bond will employ only one price from one pricing source that will be used in
all benchmark indices for which it is eligible90
Pricing Timing and Frequency
The time at which the price is taken for a particular bond is regionally based Generally bonds
are priced at 3pm New York time for US markets except Taxable Municipals which are priced at
4pm 4pm New York time for Canadian markets and 415pm London time for PanEuropean
markets For AsianPacific indices prices are taken at different times depending on the local
market convention and are subject to change based on a semiannual review 3pm Tokyo time
for Japan 5pm Shanghai time for China 5pm Tokyo time for Hong Kong Malaysia Singapore
South Korea Taiwan and Thailand 12pm London time for India and 5pm Sydney time for
Australia and New Zealand In addition Asia High Yield is priced at 5pm Tokyo time GCC91 is
priced at 415pm London time and local currency LATAM bonds are priced at 4pm New York
time When the markets close early for holidays prices may be taken earlier in the day
Most index bonds are priced daily except on market holidays
Pricing Settlement Assumptions
For index purposes securities in the SeriesL indices are assumed to settle on the next calendar
day T1 for each index pricing date except for US MBS passthroughs which are priced based
on sameday settlement T0
At monthend the settlement date is assumed to be the first day of the following month even if
the last business day is not the last calendar day of the month This procedure allows for one full
month of accrued interest to be calculated The only exception is the US MBS Index for which
endofmonth index returns are calculated assuming that the trade date and the settlement date
are the last calendar date of the month
SeriesB indices such as the World Government InflationLinked Bond Index WGILB use
local market settlement conventions for accrued interest calculations
Benchmark Index Analytics
Index users rely on a range of fixed income analytics calculated by Bloomberg to quantify
various risk exposures duration convexity volatility etc and the corresponding sensitivity to
those risks for a given security sector or asset class Comparing the analytics of a portfolio
relative to its benchmark allows investors to measure the magnitude of particular risks
embedded within their portfolios and how they relate to the broad market While some analytics
calculations are relatively straightforward and calculated in a similar manner across index
providers others rely on propriety models such as an MBS prepayment model
The following section provides an overview of the major types of analytics available for the
Bloomberg Indices duration convexity spread and yield and a brief discussion of the types of
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 53
92 In 1989 OAD also referred to as effective duration or modified adjusted duration replaced Macaulay duration as the published index duration for the benchmark
indices
93 Bloomberg uses a lognormal option model and the current price of the bond to calculate the option adjusted spread OAS of the bond
94 For example even though MBS passthroughs usually have higher yields than Treasuries they many underperform Treasuries if rates move from the base case due to
their inherent negative convexity
modeldriven researchbased metrics that have been developed in recent years Calculations
for many of these can be found in Appendix 7 Glossary of Terms  Index Analytics
Duration
While several variants of duration exist for fixed income securities investors generally think of
duration as a measure of sensitivity of a bonds price to interest rates as represented by the
change in price for a given change in yield The duration of a portfolio relative to a benchmark
can then be used to express an investors view on the interest rate environment
Option Adjusted Duration
OAD is the most widely used
duration metric for Bloomberg
Indices
Bloomberg calculates a number of measures of duration for each security including Modified
Duration Macaulay Duration and Option Adjusted Duration OAD
92 The most widely
used duration metric OAD offers perhaps the best measure of priceyield sensitivity for bonds
with embedded optionality such as securitized bonds and callable government corporate
issues OAD is calculated by shocking the par yield curve up and down by a fixed amount and
measuring the resulting change in price93 For nonUS indices ISMA duration is often used in
place of OAD The major difference between these two measures is the assumption of an annual
coupon in ISMA yield calculations instead of the semiannual coupon in the OAD calculations
In addition to OAD Bloomberg calculates key rate duration KRDs at six points on the
curve 6m 2y 5y 10y 20y and 30y The movements of the par yields at these points are
assumed to capture the overall movement of the yield curve therefore the sum approximately
equals the total OAD of the bond By shifting only part of the yield curve while holding the rest
of it fixed and repricing the bond at a constant OAS we are able to measure the sensitivity of a
bond to these different parts of the curve
To incorporate the unique risk factors and conventions of certain fixed income markets
Bloomberg calculates asset classspecific durations eg real versus nominal duration for US
TIPS and incorporates certain conventions for other asset classes such as mortgage duration
Please see the Appendix 7 Glossary of Terms  Index Analytics for more details on these fields
Convexity
Similar to duration convexity is a measure of a securitys sensitivity to interest rates However
where duration provides a linear approximation convexity is a quadratic approximation that
measures how duration changes with changes in yield Investors are particularly concerned with
convexity in environments where yield movements are large or for asset classes that are
especially sensitive to interest rates such as US MBS passthroughs
OAC measures the curvature of
the change in price of a bond as
rates move
Option Adjusted Convexity OAC is the second derivative of the priceyield function and
measures the curvature of the change in the price of a bond as interest rates move the rate of
change of OAD for a given change in rates While it is positive for conventional fixedincome
bonds it is generally negative for mortgage passthroughs The effect of negative convexity is to
dampen price appreciation if interest rates fall and aggravate the price decline if they rise94
Spread
Investors often quote the riskiness of a fixed income instrument as a spread above the return of
a reference asset usually a government bond or curve but can also be a swap curve Naturally
for taking additional spread risk investors expect to be compensated with higher yield
Spread can be used to compare risk exposures across sectors or peer groups and to make
relative value decisions for bond portfolios Investors may also target a portfolio spread that is
higher than the spread of their benchmark if their objective is outperformance However since a
higher spread typically exposes the portfolio to liquidity and issuer default risks the manager

Benchmark Index Returns Calculations and Weighting Rules
Benchmark index returns are calculated using securitylevel returns and weights that are reset at
each index rebalancing
The standard measure of bond return is total return which includes the local return from interest
accrualpayments coupon return security price movements price return and scheduled and
unscheduled payments of principal paydown return For foreign currency or multicurrency
must be comfortable that such risks are sufficiently compensated by the higher carry return
associated with higher portfolio spread Passive managers on the other hand may seek to
achieve a spread for their portfolio that is more in line with that of their benchmark
The treasury curve used in OAS
calculations corresponds to a
bonds currency denomination
A number of spread analytics are available for the indices including Option Adjusted Spread
OAS LOAS Spread to Benchmark Spread Duration and Duration Times Spread
DTS The most commonly used OAS is the constant spread that when added to all
discount rates from the treasury curve on the binomial interest rate tree model will make the
theoretical value of the future cash flows equal to the market price of the instrument The
treasury curve used will correspond to the currency denomination of a bond eg USD bonds
will be calculated against a US Treasury curve GBPdenominated bonds against a Gilt curve
JPYdenominated bonds against a JGB curve Unlike OAS Spread to Benchmark is not a
modeldriven analytic but is instead a quoted figure above an assigned security or bellwether
The security over which a bonds spread is quoted is typically an ontherun treasury but can
also be an offtherun treasury or nontreasury issue
Yield
Yield can be calculated under a number of assumptions including that an investor holds a bond
to maturity to its call date in the case of bonds with embedded optionality etc The Indices
most widely used yield metrics are yield to worst and yield to maturity though certain asset
classspecific yield measures are also calculated
The yield to worst on a bond
represents the lowest potential
yield that an investor would
receive on a bond with
embedded optionality if the
issuer does not default
Yield to maturity reflects the interest payments a bond holder is owed over the life of the bond
in addition to any gain or loss on price depending on whether the bond is priced below or
above par The yield to worst on a bond represents the lowest potential yield that an investor
would receive on a bond with embedded optionality if the issuer does not default The yield to
worst is calculated by making worstcase scenario assumptions on the issue by calculating the
returns that would be received if provisions including prepayment call or sinking fund are
used by the issuer
Yield calculations within the indices are based on an implied discount treasury curve This curve
is constructed by taking all of the cash flows of the set of liquid treasuries that are used to build
the treasury curve and then uses a splinefitting technique to determine the best discount factors
such that the set of discounted cash flows is equal to par
Derived and ModelDriven Analytics
Analytics for amortizing assets such as MBS and ABS and inflationlinked securities may also
use models that estimate variables such as prepayment speeds seasonality and other variables
that can affect duration and OAS In addition to standard duration convexity and spread
analytics these models may also be used for asset classspecific analytics such as mortgage
prepayment model projections measured by the Constant Prepayment Rate CPR Specific to
agency US MBS passthroughs CPR estimates the portion of a mortgage backed pool that will
be prepaid in the following year It is used in the calculation of analytics for MBS generics such
as duration and OAS and incorporates historical prepayments and forwardlooking estimates
The latter are based on the prepayment model maintained by the Bloomberg mortgage
research team which incorporates macroeconomic views on the housing market interest rates

indices a currency return hedged or unhedged is calculated for bonds denominated in a
currency different than the base reporting currency of the index Bloomberg also calculates
excess return that investors use as a proxy for the durationneutral return of a fixed income
spread sector
The standard methodology used to weigh securitylevel returns within a benchmark is market
value weighting an objective representation of the investment choice set for a particular index
Under this approach the weight of each indexeligible security is calculated at the beginning of
each monthly reporting period based on its price accrued interest and par amount outstanding
Other weighting schemes are also available such as cappedconstrained weights GDP weights
Fiscal Strength weights and ESG weights
Most Bloomberg bond indices are rebalanced on a monthly basis resulting in aggregated index
returns that are commonly reported on a monthtodate basis using bondlevel returns and
weights These monthtodate index returns can be used to derive daily cumulative and
periodic benchmark returns over shorter and longer reporting windows as well as multiple
rebalancing periods
This section will offer an overview of securitylevel return and weight calculations used to arrive
at benchmarklevel returns More detailed explanations of return calculations can be found in
the appendices
Bond Total Return Calculations
Published returns for Bloomberg benchmark indices measure the total return of a fixed income
instrument which includes capital appreciation and security price movements interest
payments and accruals and principal repayments scheduled or unscheduled in the case of
amortizing or sinkable bonds95 Calculating these returns requires daily bond prices accrued
interest calculations and a record of the timing and amount of coupon and principal
payments96 For multicurrency indices such as the Global Aggregate Index or single currency
indices in which the base reporting currency is different than the currency of principal and
coupon payments an additional currency return with an option to reflect hedging or not will
also be included in the total return calculation Currency return requires a number of additional
inputs including daily spot and forward FX rates and bondlevel yields
The components of a securitys total return are discussed below
Monthly Price Return
The price return for a given period is derived from changes in security price during the course of
the reporting period due to factors such as interest rate changes or spread movements and is
expressed as a percentage of the securitys beginning of period market value A clean price that
does not include accrued interest is used in the price return calculation97 even for markets that
are quoted on a dirty basis since changes in accrued interest are tracked separately as part of
the coupon return
     
   
95 Components of total return for CMBS bonds can also include writedown return which is related to the reduction in the outstanding class balance due to a loss of
principal valued at the ending price of the bond or prepayment penalty return which is due to additional penalty premiums paid in connection with certain
prepayments that are generally distributed as excess interest on the certificates See Appendix 1 Total Return Calculations for further details
96 Though generally consistent with the calculation of other fixed income asset classes tracked by Bloomberg Indices the price paydown and coupon return calculations
for US mortgage backed passthroughs differ slightly by incorporating a survival factor into the equation
97 For inflationlinked securities published price return will use inflated prices Real Price  Index Ratio and inflated accrued interest for price and coupon return
calculations and will therefore include changes in inflation in the return calculations
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 56
Monthly Coupon Return
The coupon return for a given period measures the interest income earned by a security
reflecting changes in accrued interest98 plus any interest paid during that period divided by the
dirty price of the security at the beginning of the period Coupon return is calculated in the same
manner for both fixed and floatingrate securities99
          
   
In the case of a default the ending accrued interest value is set to zero reversing out any accrual
posted since the last coupon payment and the security shows a negative coupon return
Bloomberg continues to price the security in the Returns Universe and it continues to contribute
to price return until monthend at which time it is removed from the index100
ExDividend Coupon Return
For securities that trade on an exdividend basis coupon accrual resets prior to the actual
payment date based on a predefined period of time known as the exdividend period The
length of the exdividend period can vary from market to market with some as long as 10
business days The coupon return for bonds that trade exdividend is calculated in a manner
similar to other securities However in place of an actual interest payment made in the return
calculation a coupon owed is used during the exdividend period prior to actual coupon
payment date and is discounted back to the current index settlement date
Monthly Paydown Return
Scheduled and unscheduled principal payments prior to a bonds maturity date are used to
calculate security level paydown returns which capture the gain or loss when a percentage of a
securitys par outstanding is redeemed and the security is trading at a price other than par
      100     
   
Where
principal payment  actual principal payment expressed as a percentage of par divided by the
par amount outstanding at the beginning of the period
Principal payments enter the Returns Universe as cash when they are paid but they do not earn
an additional reinvestment return for the remainder of the month
Paydown return is only calculated for amortizing or partially called bonds and is not calculated
for securities that are fully called by the issuer For fully called bonds the entire amount
outstanding redeemed enters the Returns Universe as cash at the call price any difference in the
beginning price and the called price is reflected in price return rather than the paydown return
Monthly Currency Return
A bonds currency return is derived from converting local returns to a base reporting currency
different from the underlying currency of the security If the underlying and reporting currencies
are the same currency return is zero Bloomberg calculates hedged and unhedged currency
returns for each reporting currency available for a given index
Monthly Currency Return Unhedged
The unhedged currency return is calculated as the sum of the currency appreciation between
the reporting currency and the currency denomination of a bond and the currency appreciation
of the local return

Monthly Currency Return Hedged
Hedged currency returns are designed to limit the FX exposure within an index Since the
indices rebalance monthly the hedge is put on for one month and the hedged currency return
is calculated as

Currency hedging applies to published returns only Analytics such as duration do not have a
hedged or an unhedged version in either single or multicurrency indices
For additional details on the indices currency hedging methodology for both SeriesL and
SeriesB indices see Appendix 2 Index Rules for Currency Hedging and Currency Returns
Bond Excess Return Calculations
Excess return is a metric used to quantify the durationneutral return of a security by comparing
the total return of a spread security to that of a riskfree treasury asset represented by a treasury
bond The excess return published for flagship Bloomberg benchmarks such as the US
Aggregate and Euro Aggregate Indices is an informational measure and not a tradable hedge
to reduce the treasury duration exposure of the underlying cash index101
Excess return is calculated for Bloomberg Indices using either a key rate duration matching
approach or a durationbucket approach Both of these methods are discussed in more detail in
Appendix 3 Detailed Discussion of Excess Return Computations
98 Accrued interest is calculated using a T1 calendar day settlement assumption for all securities except US MBS passthroughs which assume sameday T0
settlement and SeriesB inflationlinked and nominal government bond indices which assume local market settlement conventions On the last business day of each
month index settlement date is assumed to be the first calendar day of the following month even if the last business day is not the last calendar day of the month to
allow for a full month of accrued interest to be calculated
99 PayinKind securities that pay interest in the form of additional bonds recognize a coupon return only in the month in which additional bonds are paid Otherwise
interest does not accrue for these bonds and coupon return is zero
100 Though defaulted corporates are not eligible for Bloomberg benchmark indices such as high yield and emerging markets indices defaulted treasury and sovereign
debt remain indexeligible
101 For users looking for such benchmark solutions Bloomberg offers a family of Mirror Futures MFI and DurationHedged DHI Indices A MFI is an index whose return
reflects a funded set of Treasury futures weighted to closely match the beginning of month option adjusted duration OAD profile of an underlying standard bond
index A DHI is a funded index whose return reflects the return on the underlying cash index with its OAD exposure hedged fully or partially using its MFI For further
details see Bloomberg Mirror Futures  Duration Hedged Benchmark Indices

Index Weight Calculations
In addition to securitylevel returns the second input required for indexlevel calculations is
securitylevel weights which are reset at each index rebalancing date and available with a
variety of weighting options
Market Value Weights
Central to the construction and calculation of many Bloomberg flagship fixed income indices is a
market value weighting design The appeal of market value weighted indices lies in their
unmanaged nature and objective representations of the broad investment choice set for a given
asset class Weighting a basket of securities by outstanding debt reflects liquidity and market
capacity for the asset class resulting in indices that are largely replicable by investors managing
against them Void of any optimization or investment strategy market value weighted indices
simply measure the returns and risk characteristics of outstanding debt that meets index
eligibility criteria In cases where investors do not prefer the allocation or risk exposures of the
broad market they can express individual market views as active investment decisions to
deviate from the market value weighted benchmark
Though complex given the sheer size of the fixed income asset class market value weighted
indices are still easily understood by a range of index users and are the logical starting point for
passive investors seeking an objective measure of an asset class and active investors looking to
formulate more complicated investment strategies to outperform the market Objectivity
transparency universality market acceptance and asset class coverage are among the most
common reasons investors tend to prefer a market value weighted design Additionally
traditional market value weighted indices facilitate better comparisons of asset managers to one
another if they are using the same benchmark
The following section details the specific conventions used by Bloomberg Indices in calculating
indexlevel returns and statistics Alternative index designs to market value weighting are also
discussed
Bond Level Market Value
For each bond in Bloomberg fixed income indices market value is calculated each day based
on the bonds current par amount outstanding price and accrued interest as of the index
settlement date
          
For multicurrency indices a securitys market value can be expressed in different reporting
currencies If the principal amount outstanding of a bond is denominated in a currency different
than the index reporting currency the amount outstanding would be converted using the spot
exchange rate as of the index pricing date price and accrued will not change with different
reporting currencies as they are expressed as a percentage of par
Dayoverday changes to market value can reflect various events such as corporate actions with
adjustments to amount outstanding yield movements with price fluctuations or an increase in
interest payment due to a bond holder with changes in accrued interest
BondLevel Market Value Weights for Index Return Calculations
The market value of each bond within the Returns Universe of an index is set at the outset of
each monthly index reporting period as of the previous monthend index rebalancing date
These Beginning market values are used to derive static securitylevel weights for index level
return aggregation until the next index rebalancing102 The market value used for each bond is
the same across all market value weighted indices and their related subindices by sector
maturity currency etc
        
   
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 59
In alternative weight indices such as those that limit issuer concentration or target specified
sector allocations each securitys contribution to indexlevel return is still based on securitylevel
market values at the beginning of the month To satisfy the alterative weighting criteria the
amount outstanding for each bond is adjusted in a rulesbased manner based on the specific
weighting methodology This adjusted amount outstanding is used to calculate indexlevel
returns and is held constant throughout the month for each bond in the Returns Universe
BondLevel Weights for Index Statistics Calculations
Indexlevel statistics such as duration yield and OAS are weighted by the daily or Ending
market value of each indexeligible bond in the Projected Universe Published sector allocation
percentages for flagship indices are also based on the Projected Universe using ending market
value103
        
   
In alternative weight indices the amount outstanding for each bond in the Projected Universe is
rescaled each day based on current price and accrued interest to effectively rebalance overall
market value exposures based on the specific alternative weighting scheme As a result index
users will see the Projected Universe of an index meet the market value targets of an alternative
weighting scheme each day even though Returns Universe weights may drift from their initial
targets
Alternative Weighting Options
Given the size and diversity of the fixed income investor base some investors may prefer a
departure from the standard market value weighting of Bloomberg flagship indices based on
inclusion criteria or weighting methodology The reasons for choosing an alternative index
design are varied but a common thread running through investors rationale is that the index
characteristics and risk profile of a market value weighted benchmark do not accurately
represent their portfolio objective or risk tolerance
Common index alternatives to flagship market value indices that are designed to achieve
specific benchmark objectives are discussed below
Target Allocations in Composite Indices
Index solutions for investors looking to match a specific investment policy allocation tend to be
straightforward blends or composites of existing indices or subindices with weights matching
their policy allocation As long as the subcomponents exist as standalone indices almost any
allocationbased index is possible For example if a fixed income managers preferred allocation
across credit rating within the Bloomberg US Corporate Index is 20 Baarated with the
remainder of their benchmark rated A or better a benchmark can be constructed to match that
allocation
Capped Indices
Alternative index designs available to investors looking to manage concentration risk generally
consist of capped or diversified indices that apply strict exposure limits within the benchmark
based on issuer weights sector weights country exposure etc For example investors
concerned with idiosyncratic risk especially prevalent in high yield bond portfolios may use an
issuer capped index which limits the exposure of any one issuer to a specified percentage of
the overall benchmark based on market value
Fundamentally Themed Indices
Investors concerned with concentration risk or those who believe it is counterintuitive to assign a
higher weight to more indebted issuers may use an advanced index design that uses or
incorporates fundamental factors instead of outstanding debt to determine index allocations
102 For other analytics and statistics dynamic market values as of each index calculation date are used and are reported for the Projected Universe index composition
103 To avoid a circular reference average price and coupon are weighted by end of period par value
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 60
The Bloomberg GDP weighted indices employ such a strategy with GDP a proxy of a countrys
ability to service its debt used as the basis for countrylevel weights within a benchmark
Another weighting option is Bloomberg Fiscal Strength weighted methodology which uses
measures of financial solvency debt as a percentage of GDP deficit as a percentage of GDP
dependence on external financing current account balance as a percentage of GDP and
governance to adjust market value weights at the country level Bloomberg MSCI ESG weighted
indices are another fundamentally themed alternative that uses Environmental Social and
Governance issuer ratings as a factor to adjust market value weights in an existing benchmark
bond index
Risk Weighted Indices
Risk weighted indices look at estimates of asset class returns correlations and volatilities as the
basis of different security or subindex allocations These types of indices can represent different
risk weighting themes such as risk parity volatility budgeting risk budgeting and minimum
volatility portfolio optimization
Index Return Calculations and Aggregation
With securitylevel returns and weights it is possible to calculate and publish aggregated indexlevel returns and risk analytics Benchmark index returns are reported over various periods
daily monthly annual etc yet monthly returns are the most commonly referenced since they
correspond with the monthly rebalancing of index constituents104
Monthly Index Return Calculations
Bond level returns and weights are the inputs used to calculate published monthly index level
returns Local currency returns at the bond level will be consistent across Bloomberg Indices
but total returns will vary from index to index based on the base reporting currency and whether
the index is currency hedged or unhedged Bond index weights are indexspecific based on the
universe of eligible bonds
        
Cumulative and Periodic Total Return Calculations
Since Inception Total Return and Index Value
For each Bloomberg index the cumulative total return since index inception is calculated and
used to determine periodic returns over longer andor intramonth time horizons Since
inception total return SITR is calculated at the index level and is a compounded return linking
historical index cumulative monthly returns and the current monthtodate return This approach
assumes that the index is always fully invested in the new Returns Universe after each monthly
rebalancing and that any accumulated cash from the previous month is reinvested pro rata into
the new universe
     100    1     100
From the since inception total return an index level is calculated by adding 100 and is used to
calculate total returns over any given time period where index levels are available
     100
104 Returns over a given interval are calculated from endofday to endofday For example the return for October 2016 is calculated from September 30 2016 to
October 31 2016 and includes interest earned on October 31 2016 but not interest earned on September 30 2016
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 61
Daily Total Return Calculations
All daily returns total return price return currency return paydown return and coupon return
are calculated as the difference in the monthtodate return for the prior date and the monthtodate return for the current date compounded for one day105
          1
1    1100
Periodic Excess Return Calculations
Because excess returns are the arithmetic differences between the total return of the index and a
durationmatched hypothetical riskfree security compounding monthly excess returns is not an
accurate way to display excess returns over time frames longer than one month However
whereas excess return cannot be compounded total return can Bloomberg publishes both the
total and excess return for each index monthly so we are also able to calculate a total return of
the implied durationmatched treasury portfolio of that index the difference between the excess
and total returns of the index
Mathematically the total return of the index and the implied treasury portfolio can then be
compounded separately and compared even as its composition is reset every month yielding a
valid periodic excess return derived from the arithmetic differences between the two
Duration HedgedMirror Futures Index Return Calculations
Bloomberg offers two types of indices  Mirror Futures Indices MFI and Duration Hedged
Indices DHI  for investors seeking to adjust the duration of their fixed income benchmarks
while preserving the broad coverage and diversification of their existing fixed income
investment set These indices may be used to replace existing portfolio benchmarks reference
indices for various replication strategies or measure interest rate durationhedged fully or
partially bond market returns
 Mirror Futures Index An index whose return reflects a funded set of Treasury futures
contracts weighted to match closely the beginningofthemonth optionadjusted duration
OAD profile of an underlying standard bond index For example the US Aggregate MFI will
include five US Treasury futures contracts weighted to match the OAD profile and market
value of the US Aggregate Index plus a cash investment a funding component in US
Treasury bills
 Duration Hedged Index A funded index whose return reflects the return on the underlying
index with its OAD exposure hedged fully or partially using its MFI For example the US
Aggregate DHI is the US Aggregate less its MFI plus the MFIs funding component added

Total Return Calculations SeriesB Indices
The calculation methodology outlined below applies to the SeriesB indices which includes flagship inflationlinked indices such
as the WGILB EGILB and EMGILB and the government bond family such as the Euro UK and US Government Bond Indices and
the US and Euro Term Indices While SeriesB and SeriesL indices use similar methodology for total return calculation they differ in
terms of settlement conventions SeriesB indices use standard local settlement and exdividend conventions for all calculations
whereas SeriesL indices use T1 settlement universally except US MBS passthroughs which use a same day T0 settlement
assumption
The SeriesB Indices returns are calculated daily starting with a base value of 100 on the base date

Appendix 2 Index Rules for Currency Hedging and Currency Returns
Investors frequently ask how to hedge portfolio positions so as to best match index currency
exposures We discuss the currency aspects of index return calculations with special emphasis
on the procedure used in currencyhedged indices The following section details rules for
SeriesL indices
Unhedged Returns
Consider an investor who buys foreign currency at the beginning of the month and sells the
position back into base currency at the end of the month The realized capital gain from this
investment in foreign currency is
    

 1
FXbeg and FXend are the base currency values of one unit of the foreign currency at the
beginning and the end of the return period respectively
Consider an investor who buys a bond denominated in a foreign currency at the beginning of
the month and at the end of the month sells the bond and converts the foreign currency
proceeds back into the base currency The investors basecurrency realized return on
investment is
     1     1     1 2
           
To keep analytics as intuitive and tractable as possible Bloomberg decomposes index returns
into additive components Accordingly currency return108 is defined as follows
          3
where
          
Currency return is the difference between basecurrency return and local return Substituting
Equation 2 into Equation 3 provides
           4
 1      
The currency return on the bond is not equal to the capital gain on a pure currency investment
From Equation 1 the base currency capital gain on a pure currency investment is FX
Appreciation while the bonds currency return is FX Appreciation  local return  FX
Appreciation The bonds currency return contains an interaction component local return  FX
Appreciation in addition to the capital gain on a currency investment
Example Unhedged Returns
Consider an index with the euro as the base currency and which contains the USDdenominated
PEMEX bond described in Figure 17 The local return on this bond in April 2013 was 350 The
total euro return on an unhedged position in this bond was 081 From Equation 3 the index
currency return for an unhedged position in this bond was 081350 which equals 269
The currency return on this bond can also be calculated from Equation 4 In this case the
EURUSD exchange rate was 12841 at the beginning of April and 13184 at the end of April Thus
108 The Bloomberg Indices source FX spot and forward rates from Refinitiv FX rates are taken at 4pm London time
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 68
the value of one US dollar fell from 0778756 euros at the start of April to 0758495 euros at the
end of April109
Here FX Appreciation is 0758495  07787560778756 or 260 During April the US dollar
lost 260 of its value when measured in euros From Equation 4 the currency return is
10350 00260 which equals 269 and matches the previous currency return calculation
The difference between the 260 euro return for investments in US dollar cash and the 269
currency return on the PEMEX bond is 9bp which exactly equals the value of the interaction
term 003500026
Finally the base currency total return for the PEMEX bond can be calculated directly from
Equation 2 In the current example the product of 1  local return and 1  FX Appreciation is
10350 09740 which comes to 10081 Subtracting one provides the bonds 081 total return
in euros

Sample Implementation Unhedged Returns
Figure 18 provides the set of actual transactions that an investor could use to generate the
unhedged index return for the PEMEX bond in April 2013 The only potential discrepancy
between the investors realized euro return from these transactions and the index euro return is
the investors inability to ensure that trades are executed exactly at index prices
To replicate the index return the investor uses 86759 euros to buy 111407 dollars at the spot FX
rate at the close of business on March 31 The US dollar proceeds are used simultaneously to
purchase the PEMEX bond At the close of business on April 30 the investor sells the PEMEX
bond and in return receives 115314 dollars which is simultaneously sold in the spot FX market
for 87465 euros These transactions result in a euro return of 081
Hedged Returns
Now consider the currencyhedged version of the index containing the PEMEX bond For
currencyhedged indices as well as unhedged indices the currency return satisfies the relation
         
One can verify this using the numbers in Figure 19 The Bloomberg Indices report a currencyhedged total return of 340 EUR for this bond Subtracting the 350 local return comes to

010 which equals the reported currency return for the bond in the currencyhedged version
of the index
While the definition of currency return remains unchanged the calculation of base currency total
return becomes somewhat more complicated for currencyhedged indices The index position
in a bond denominated in a foreign currency for a hedged index is actually a position in two
instruments the bond plus a onemonth currency forward
     5a
          
where
base currency total return unhedged is provided in Equation 2
H is the size of the hedge measured in local currency
     

 5b
Forward Value is the number of base currency units to be received for each unit of the local
currency delivered in the forward contract This value is set in the marketplace at the beginning
of the month and received at delivery at the end of the month
Equation 3 can be used to reexpress as follows
     6
           
Note that the second term on the right hand side of Equation 6 moves in the opposite
direction as the third term If the hedge were perfect these terms would reduce to a constant
and remove all sensitivity to the exchange rate at the end of the month
Equation 5a is general It provides the base currency total return under any hedging rule By
setting H according to index rules Equation 5a becomes a full specification of base currency
total return for Bloomberg Indices
For securities other than mortgages Bloomberg indices set H as follows
  1  216 7
H is a projected endofmonth market value per unit of local currency invested at the beginning
of the month In Equation 7 localcurrency security value is projected to grow at the rate
implied by its yield For nonbullet bonds Equation 7 uses yield to worst
The perfect currency hedge for the April return would set H equal to the bonds endofApril
localcurrency value However the perfect hedge could not be obtained by an actual investor at
the beginning of April the local currency value of the index at the end of April is not known on
March 31 when the hedge must be implemented Index construction always stresses the
importance of investability In this spirit the index does not use endofmonth values in
determining the currency hedge The yield in Equation 7 is the yield at the beginning of the
month
Returning to the PEMEX 4875 coupon bond Figure 20 reports that the yield on this bond at
the beginning of April was 3481 and that 0778598 euros will be received for every US dollar
delivered in current 1m currency forwards Therefore H is 100288 and the forward return is
2581 Using these values in Equation 5a together with the bonds 081 unhedged basecurrency return results in 340 the bonds currencyhedged total euro return

For each currency the hedge for the entire index is the average of security hedges weighted by
the beginningofthemonth index weight Thus the hedge for the April index return is the
weighted average of the individual April security hedges using security market weights from the
beginning of April

according to hedged index rules

All of the components of the first term in Equation 8 are known at the time the hedge is
implemented This first term is often referred to as the carry from the hedge In the PEMEX
example its value is 100288  0778598  0778756  0778756 or 20bp
Since index hedges are designed to be implementable by investors at the beginning of the
month they are not perfect the bond will have residual currency exposure in the index after
hedging This residual currency exposure is equal to the difference between the size of the
hedge and the market value of the security at the end of the month The FX appreciation
realized by this exposure is measured by the second term in Equation 8 The exact value of this
term will not be known until the end of the month In our example this term is 10340  100288
 260 which equals 81bp These two terms sum to the reported 10bp currency return for
the bond in the hedged index While 10bp is a fairly large magnitude for a hedged currency
return it is less than onetwentieth the size of the unhedged currency return

EndofMonth Roll of Currency Hedging Positions
A statistic hedge market value is available to help investors who wish to match index hedging
procedures Hedge market value applies index currency hedging rules to determine the onemonth hedge for the position These hedges are calculated based on market values from the
current close of business Hedge market value provides the hypothetical hedge that the index
would implement today for a position of this magnitude if the current day were a monthend
At the actual monthend hedge market value reports the exact hedge that the index would use
to hedge the position over the upcoming month Prior to monthend hedge market value can
be viewed as an approximation of the hedge to be implemented at the beginning of the next
month This approximation becomes more precise as the month progresses and becomes exact
at the actual monthend it is designed to help investors roll forward their currency hedges at the
end of the month
Using Hedges of Longer Tenors
For many global investors the amounts that need to be hedged in each currency are fairly
stable from month to month Therefore although the index hedges with onemonth currency
forwards many investors choose to use threemonth contracts While the use of threemonth
currency forwards introduces tracking error relative to a currencyhedged benchmark these
investors are willing to bear the tracking error for a variety of reasons One justification is the
perception that rolling a hedge four times a year in the threemonth market entails lower
execution costs than rolling the position twelve times a year in the onemonth market Another
possible motivation depending on the shapes of the two forward curves is that the hedging
cost which is based on the deposit rate differential can sometimes be significantly lower at
longer tenors While such strategies may add value investors need to be aware that by
extending the tenor of the hedge they are essentially adding a view on shortterm interest rates
to their portfolios
Common Questions about Currency Returns for Bloomberg Indices
Q Why arent unhedged currency returns exactly the same for all bonds denominated in a
given currency
A All bonds in a given currency will be subject to the same change in FX rates which is denoted
as FX Appreciation in this article However because Bloomberg expresses currency returns
using an additive convention the reported currency return also depends on the local return of a
bond as shown in Equation 4 Thus different bonds or indices denominated in the same
currency can have different currency returns
Q Why do hedged indices have currency returns Isnt the currency risk hedged away
A Hedging can eliminate the majority of currency risk but there is no way for foreign investors
to earn exactly the same return as local investors for two reasons First there is no way to know
at the beginning of a month exactly what the market value of a given investment will be at the
end of the month The amount by which the size of the hedge is different from the ultimate endofmonth market value either too big or too small results in a usually small exposure to
changes in FX rates Second even if we assume that the hedge is set up in exactly the right size
there is a carry component which can be either positive or negative that corresponds to the
difference between spot and forward rates
The carry is proportional to the difference between the shortterm deposit rates in the two
currencies One will pay up to shift cash to a higheryielding currency on a hedged basis this
negative carry is sometimes referred to as the cost of the hedge A shift to a lower yielding
currency on a hedged basis will yield a positive carry essentially compensating the investor for
the extra yield that has been foregone
Both of these components of hedged currency return are seen explicitly in the formulation of
Equation 8 in which the first term corresponds to the carry and the second to the FX return on
the market value that remains unhedged
Q How is the size of the hedge determined in Bloomberg Indices
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 73
A The size of the hedge is not assumed to be the ending market value which cannot be known
at the start of the month It is also not assumed to be the beginning market value since this
would result in a systematic bias toward underhedging Bloomberg uses a simple projection of
endofmonth market value based on the combination of beginningofmonth market value and
yield
Q How are hedged returns calculated intramonth
A To calculate intramonth hedged returns Bloomberg assumes that the FX forward contract is
unwound using a prorated forward rate A 30day contract is assumed for every month
regardless of the actual number of days in a month111
Q What are the differences between SeriesL and Series B currency hedging
methodologies
A The precise hedging methodologies used to calculate hedged returns for both the SeriesL
and SeriesB indices are very similar but some slight nuances do exist that would result in small
differences in returns between SeriesL and SeriesB indices if one were to compare the hedged
returns for the same index The most significant difference is that the SeriesL indices use
projected monthend market values to calculate the amount to be hedged for the forthcoming
month whereas the SeriesB indices simply use the beginning of month market values or as it is
sometimes labelled the Current Value method All things being equal the difference between
the projected market value and the beginning of month market value is likely to be marginal
but when comparing with SeriesB hedged returns for the same index this methodological
difference between the market values is likely to be the most significant source of tracking error
Derivation of Hedged Market Value SeriesL
Projected endofmonth market value versus beginningofmonth market value for hedged
amount
Forward rate agreements are entered into for the projected endofmonth market value of
SeriesL indices using the beginningofmonth bond yield

6
Derivation of Hedged Market Value SeriesB
For SeriesB indices forward rate agreements are entered into only for the beginningofmonth
market value Any subsequent appreciation or depreciation in the value of the index is
unhedged until the next hedge is taken out
One other methodological difference worthy of a mention is the different methods used to
calculate intramonth hedged values The two index series use a slightly different method of
interpolating the intramonth forward rate for intramonth hedged index statistics
Method of Interpolating IntraMonth Forward Rate SeriesL
The prorated forward rate used by SeriesL indices to unwind a FX forward contract on an intramonth day i is an interpolation between the spot  and 1month forward rates 1 at the
beginning of the month A 30day contract is assumed for every month regardless of the actual
number of days in a month
    1   
    
30
111 To calculate the number of days for which the forward contract is unwound users need to account for the T1 calendar day settlement assumption of the indices T0
for mortgages Using such an assumption intramonth means that the day count as of a Friday business day will not include the weekend days The unwind of the
forward contract will account for those days on the first business day after the weekend
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 74
Method of Interpolating IntraMonth Forward Rate SeriesB
The interpolated forward FX rate for SeriesB indices on an intramonth day i is calculated by
linear interpolation between the spot  and 1month forward rates 1 on day i Actual
number of days are used for SeriesB index hedging calculations
    1   
    
      
Currency Returns and Hedging for SeriesB Indices
Returns for Bloomberg SeriesB inflationlinked and government indices are also available in
foreign currency and hedged versions For SeriesB indices Bloomberg uses a current value
methodology This method hedges only the market value in each of the currencies at the
beginning of each month after any reweighting of the index constituents and does not assume
perfect foresight As a result there will be an element of currency mismatch at the end of the
month if the value of the portfolio holdings in the currency changes112
The following section provides a detailed explanation of how foreign currency and hedged
versions of index are calculated for SeriesB indices
Unhedged and Hedged Return Indices
Foreign Currency Total Return Index Unhedged
The foreign currency versions of the local currency index are calculated using the local index

Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 75
MultiCurrency Index Hedge
In an index income is reinvested across all the bonds in proportion to their weight This takes
place as soon as income is received hence the weight will depend on the local market price
and in the case of a multicurrency basket on the currency cross rates Given this reinvestment
strategy we cannot observe the local currency return in the same way as described above
Instead we use a simpler breakdown
Index return in the desired currency
Profit or loss on the hedge itself or in this case on a series of currency hedges
Calculating a Daily Hedged Index
To provide a daily estimate of the performance of the Monthly Hedged Index the currency
hedge is marked to market daily This is done by unwinding the forward position and adjusting
the return on the hedge The hedge return is then combined with the monthtodate local
currency return and the unhedged currency return to give an overall monthtodate hedged
index return and hence the hedged index level
As stated above this is a daily estimation of the Monthly Hedged Index not a true Daily Hedged
Index This is to provide continuity between the monthly and daily hedged total return series
Pricing the Offsetting Forward
To mark the initial onemonth forward position we use an offsetting forward to the end of the
month This is more precise than using the spot rate because it takes into account expected
interest rate differentials for the remainder of the month
The easiest way to explain this is to look at an example Suppose we are 10 days into the month
and that the last business day of this month is the 28th We would need to offset the starting
onemonth forward with an 18day forward ie 28  10  18 days In theory we could obtain an
18day rate directly for the forward market in practice only certain periods tenors are quoted
and we need to interpolate to arrive at a rate for the desired period
For the sake of simplicity we use a linear interpolation based on the current onemonth forward
and spot rates In our example we calculate the 18day forward rate as the current spot rate plus
the premium or discount between spot and 1m forward prorated for 18 days

Appendix 3 Detailed Discussion of Excess Return Computations
The fixed income community generally gauges the compensation for holding risky assets by
measuring performance of spread product asset classes relative to the treasury asset class It
follows that for an individual security a portfolio or an entire asset class excess returns offer a
more pure measure of this compensation than nominal returns
While many different excess return calculation methodologies exist the differences mainly
reflect the various ways to define an equivalent treasury position The simplest technique
compares the return of a spread sector security to the closest ontherun Treasury while more
precise methods require the equivalent Treasury position to match the duration of the spread
security One of these more precise methods known as the durationbucket approach
calculates an equivalent Treasury return for each duration neighborhood and bases the excess
return calculation on the average returns on Treasuries and spread sectors partitioned into semiannual duration cells Since the duration of a security does not fully reflect its yield curve
exposure particularly for securities with embedded optionality such as callable bonds or MBS
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 78
an even more precise method is to fully characterize each securitys exposure along the curve
using a set of key rate durations KRDs Then its return can be compared with that of a
hypothetical Treasury portfolio with the same KRD profile
The following discussion details how key rate durations are calculated and used to construct
equivalent treasury positions which are then used to compute excess returns for US securities
The durationbucket approach which is used for nonUS securities is also discussed The
precise excess return computations are then complemented with an intuitive approximation
based on option adjusted spread OAS which explains how to properly weigh portfolio level
spreads and spread changes to allow aggregated analytics to be used in excess return
approximations
Using Key Rate Duration to Compute Excess Returns
The US Treasury offtherun yield curve is modeled daily by fitting a smooth discount curve to
the prices of US Treasury securities In addition a term structure of volatility is fitted to a selected
set of caps and swaptions These fitted curves serve as the basis for the Bloomberg OAS
models a lognormal tree model for government and corporate securities and a Monte Carlo
simulation model for mortgage backed securities In both models sensitivities to changes in
interest rates are measured by shocking the yield curve by a fixed amount keeping volatility
constant and repricing each security at a constant OAS This mechanism is used to calculate
option adjusted durations as sensitivities to a parallel shift in the Treasury par curve
Key rate durations are sensitivities to the movement of specific parts of the par yield curve The
movements of the par yields at six key points along the curve 6 months 2 years 5 years 10
years 20 years and 30 years to maturity are assumed to capture the overall movement of the
yield curve In other words sensitivities of a security to these six yields summarize its exposure to
yield curve movements To compute these sensitivities or KRDs the yield curve is perturbed by
applying a change in the par yield curve around each of these points one at a time and repricing the bond at a constant OAS The sum of the six key rate durations is approximately equal
to the option adjusted duration while the distribution of the bonds duration among the six
KRDs gives a more detailed view of how it will respond to different types of yield curve moves
Calculating Excess Returns Using KRDs
To calculate excess returns using KRDs Bloomberg first constructs a set of six hypothetical par
coupon treasuries corresponding exactly to the maturities of the six KRDs of a spread security at
the beginning of the month To the six hypothetical bonds each priced exactly off the curve at
zero OAS a riskless onemonth cash security is added A combination of these seven securities
is then used to match the market value and KRD profile of the security at the beginning of the
month This combination constitutes the equivalent treasury position to which a securitys return
is compared The KRDmatched hypothetical treasuries are held constant throughout the month
and not rebalanced intramonth due to change in the KRD profile of the security to which it is
being compared At monthend each of the hypothetical par coupon treasuries is repriced at
zero OAS off the endofmonth treasury return and its total return for the month is calculated
The excess return for the security is then calculated as the difference between its total return and
that of the equivalent treasury position
DurationBucket Approach
A durationbucket approach is used to calculate excess returns for nonUS benchmark indices
Using this methodology Bloomberg first buckets the universe of treasuries that correspond to a
bonds currency denomination114 into halfyear duration buckets starting at zero Treasuries are
bucketed based on their beginningofmonth duration values and will not change buckets intramonth A market value weighted return is then calculated for each halfyear duration bucket
The return for a given securitys durationmatched riskfree asset is interpolated from its duration
at the beginning of the month and the duration and total return of the two adjacent treasury
114 For EURdenominated securities this basket is comprised of German bunds only Prior to July 1 2013 the basket also included French and Dutch treasuries
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 79
buckets The excess return for the security is then calculated as the difference between its total
return and the interpolated return115
Approximating Excess Returns from OAS
OASBased Excess Return Calculation
As discussed previously no excess return methodology has been standardized in the fixed
income market For the basis of comparison we use a simple approximation based on sources
of excess return for a spread product to derive excess returns at the index level Securities
considered riskier than treasuries usually earn a spread over treasury yields when the spread
remains unchanged the excess return should be approximately equal to the spread itself When
spreads change and the risk of spread securities is realized the additional excess return is
given by the change in spread multiplied by the spread duration
Let

i S  Option adjusted spread OAS
Di  Spread duration
i S  Monthly change in OAS
Our simple firstorder approximation for monthly excess return is given by
1 i i
i
i D S S ER   
12
The simplicity of this approximation might lead one to ask why this should not be adopted as
the official Bloomberg definition of excess return The simple model does not cover all possible
sources of return differences between treasuries and spread product however For example
called bonds generate excess return due to volatility changes even with an unchanged optionadjusted spread Additionally returns on mortgage backed securities are affected by
prepayment surprises and volatility changes in addition to spread moves For these reasons it is
important to retain a model that works in return space at the security level by subtracting an
equivalent treasury return from the total return of each spread security
While an OAS approximation for excess return may not be rigorously correct for instruments that
are volatility sensitive it provides intuitive results for a largely noncallable index such as the US
Credit Index
In the application of the OASbased approach for portfolio or indexlevel excess returns one
detail merits a closer look It is important to pay attention to the weighting mechanism used to
compute portfolio averages While the spread levels should be weighted by market value the
changes in spreads should be weighted by dollar duration the product of market value and
spread duration A failure to do so can lead to inaccuracies when the market experiences
changes in the term structure of spreads
For a portfolio let wi represent the percentage of portfolio market value in security i The onemonth excess return for the portfolio is then the weighted sum of the component securities

Let us look at how this calculation can be expressed in terms of portfolio level quantities The
portfolio averages for spread duration spread and spread change can be interpolated as
follows where the superscript MW refers to a market weighted portfolio and the superscript
DDW denotes a dollar duration weighted average The quantity DP
MW is the market weighted
average portfolio spread duration sP
MW is the market weighted average portfolio OAS and

The first term of equation 2 is given by the market weighted spread In the second term the
duration cancels out the denominator of the duration weighted spread leaving an expression
identical to that found in equation 2
This weighting scheme is in accord with our intuition The first component corresponds to the
return that will be earned by each security if its spread remains unchanged The spread should
be weighted by market value as are returns The second term represents the return effect of
spread changes Spread changes in longer securities will have a greater effect and should be
given greater weights
Calculating Periodic and Cumulative Excess Returns
Since excess returns are the arithmetic differences between the total return of the index and a
durationmatched hypothetical risk free security compounding monthly excess returns is not an
accurate way to display excess returns over timeframes longer than one month But whereas
excess returns cannot be compounded total returns can Since Bloomberg publishes both the
total and excess returns of each index monthly we also calculate a total return of the implied
durationmatched treasury portfolio of that index the difference between the excess and total
returns of the index
Mathematically total returns of the index and the implied treasury portfolio can then be
compounded separately and compared even as its composition is reset every month yielding a
valid periodic excess return derived from the arithmetic differences between the two
The following example explains the technique using a threemonth horizon January 2013
March 2013
Let
TRindex  Total Return of the Index
ERindex  Excess Return of the Index
TRimpliedtsy  Total Return of the Implied Duration Matched Treasury Portfolio
For any given month
TRindex  ERindex TRimpliedtsy

The US MBS Index tracks fixedrate mortgagebacked passthrough securities issued by Ginnie
Mae GNMA Fannie Mae FNMA and Freddie Mac FHLMC The index is composed of MBS
generics that group the larger universe of eligible agency mortgage passthrough pools
according to four main characteristics agency program coupon and vintage The US MBS
Index used to also track Hybrid ARM pools but this sector was retired on June 1 2017 and the
index now only contains fixedrate securities
Prices for indexeligible MBS
generics are calculated using a

The index is formed by grouping the universe of about 1 million individual TBA deliverable fixedrate MBS pools into approximately 5500 cohorts These cohorts are based on agency

the index Beginning July 2019 the index separates the Freddie 45 and 55day delay Freddie
generics to reflect UMBS initiative
Specified pools have particular characteristics that differentiate them from more generic pools
Specified pool buyers know exactly which mortgage pools they are buying and will generally
pay a higher premium over generic pools For this reason specified pools are excluded from
the index pricing process
The index prices assume sameday settlement using either estimated or actual paydowns
throughout the month depending on the day The index reflects an estimate of paydowns
starting on the first business day of the month and the actual paydowns after the 16th business
day of the month
For every underlying nonspecified pool that maps to an index cohort BVAL provides a T0
price The price of an index cohort is then calculated using an outstanding balance weighted
average of the pool prices in that cohort117

Accrued Interest The amount of interest as a percentage of par that accrues between the last coupon date and
the current index settlement date owed to a buyer of the bond
Alternative Weight Indices Indices that use rulesbased weighting schemes other than standard market value weights
Examples are GDP Weighted Fiscal Strength Weighted and ESG Weighted Indices
AUM Assets Under Management
Base Currency
The specified reporting currency of a published index Returns for indexeligible securities in a
currency other than the base currency are converted into base currency returns on an
unhedged or a hedged basis
BCIX Function on Bloomberg to access Bloomberg InflationLinked and SeriesB Indices
Class 14
Fourpillar Treasury GovernmentRelated Corporate and Securitized classification of
securities by issuer sectorindustry in Bloomberg Indices launched in 2005 and backfilled
historically There are up to four levels of granularity within each pillar
Bellwether
Bellwether indices track ontherun US Treasury issuance for the 3m 6m 2y 3y 5y 10y and
30y issues Bellwethers can also refer to the specific instrument against which the spread of a
bond is quoted
Breakeven Inflation
The spread that relates nominal and inflationlinked treasury bond prices To calculate
breakeven inflation the market convention takes the difference between the real yield on an
inflationlinked security and the nominal yield on a similar maturity nominal treasury
Breakeven inflation is an approximation that allows for a relative value analysis representing
the point of indifference between owning an inflationlinked and a nominal treasury bond
Over the life of a bond if the realized rate of inflation exceeds the breakeven rate the
inflationlinked security will outperform the nominal security
Canadian Model
Refers to the way in which many inflationlinked bonds trade The notable characteristic of the
Canadian Model is that it allows all calculations to be done in real terms with a conversion
factor to adjust into a nominal price on any given day
Capital Security Deeply subordinated fixed income securities that qualify for treatment as regulatory capital by
regulators or receive quasiequity credit from ratings agencies
Capped Index Indices that cap exposure to a certain index attribute such as issuer or country of risk to a
fixed percentage
Composite Index
Indices in which fixed weights are assigned to various subcomponents commonly defined as
currency country sector maturity or credit quality subindices to match a specified or
targeted portfolio allocation Weights will rebalance back to the target weights at each
rebalancing
Contingent Capital
Capital securities sometimes referred to as CoCos that convert into equity or are written
down based on explicit capital ratioviability triggers CoCos are not eligible for Bloomberg
Aggregate indices but are tracked in a standalone benchmark
Country
Country of risk of an indexeligible security The primary criteria for classifying country of risk
are where a bonds guarantee originates if the issuer is backed by a government or parent
corporate entity where the largest source of revenue operations or cash flows is generated
from the issuer and the location of an issuers headquarters or where its centralized decisionmaking occurs Additional criteria that may be used include the country of incorporation or
legal domicile where an issuers stock is listed and traded and where existing issuers within
the index that are similarly structured or organized are classified
Coupon Return Returns derived from the interest payments accrued andor received during the return period
Covered Bond
Recourse debt instrument that is secured by a ringfenced pool of assets on an issuers
balance sheet commercial real estate residential mortgages public sector loans or other
assets Within the indices global classification scheme covered bonds are classified within a
subsector of Securitized
CPI Type The Consumer Price Index CPI series to which an inflationlinked bond is linked eg
French CPI ex tobacco HICP
Currency Return Returns hedged or unhedged derived from converting local currency security returns to a
base reporting currency
CUSIP
Security identification number for the US and Canada A CUSIP consists of eight alphanumeric
characters The first six identify the issuer the following two identify the issue A ninth check
digit is left off identifiers in Bloomberg Indices
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 94
Dated Date
The date on which interest begins to accrue on a fixed income bond Investors who purchase a
bond between interest payment dates must pay the seller or issuer any interest that has
accrued from the dated date to the purchase date or settlement date
Day Count Convention
The calendar conventions used to calculate accrued interest and other cash flowbased
analytics for a given bond as of a given settlement date Represented as number of days per
monthnumber of days per year day count convention may vary from security type and local
market Examples include 30360 ACT360 ACTACT etc
Defaulted Bond
For index purposes a security is considered to be in default if it has missed a scheduled
interest payment has an index rating of D based on the indices credit quality methodology
or is trading flat Defaulted securities are not eligible for corporate high yield indices however
defaulted emerging markets sovereigns remain index eligible
Discount Margin Incremental spread earned above a specific reference rate for a floatingrate bond
Dividends Received Deductible
DRD
An equitylike security for which interest payments are partially subject to income tax for the
end investor These types of securities are excluded from Bloomberg Indices
Duration Extension
This quantifies the instant index duration change that occurs when the index membership is
reset each monthend It accounts for monthly index turnover but also factors in the outflow of
accumulated cash as the index is reset It is calculated as the difference between the OAD of
the Returns Universe and Projected Universe at monthend
DurationHedged Index DHI An index whose return reflects that on the underlying cash index with its OAD exposure
hedged fully or partially using its Mirror Future Index MFI
Emerging Market
Bloomberg uses a fixed list of countries defined as emerging markets countries for index
inclusion purposes that is based on World Bank Income group definitions LowMiddle IMF
country classifications NonAdvanced Economies and other advanced economies that may
be less accessible or investable for global debt investors
Enhanced Equipment Trust
Certificates EETC
A type of passthrough security commonly used in aircraft finance in the US In the transaction
a trust certificate is sold to investors to finance the purchase of an aircraft by a trust which then
leases it to the airline and the trustee passes payment through the trust to the investors EETC
bonds are eligible for Bloomberg Indices and are classified as corporates within the global
classification scheme
ESG
Environmental Social and Governance ESG is an investment themeset of criteria used to
evaluate nonfinancial risks to which an investment is exposed in an investment portfolio An
established investment theme in equities ESG is emerging as a more prominent consideration
in fixed income and can be evaluated using Bloomberg MSCI ESG Fixed Income Indices
EurodollarEuroyen US dollardenominated bond issued outside the USJapanese yendenominated securities
issued outside of Japan
Excess Return
Measure of performance of a spread security over that of an equivalent treasury security For
municipal bonds excess return is calculated over the nonzero noncallable Aaa GO durationneutral curve
Exchange Traded Fund ETF
A registered and exchange listed investment fund that is generally designed to track a bond or
equity benchmark index passively though active ETFs do exist Bloomberg fixed income
benchmark indices are licensed by a number of ETF providers
Expected Rating
When the credit rating assigned by a rating agency is referred to as expected it generally
indicates that a full rating has been assigned based on the agencys expectations of receiving
final documentation from the issuer Once the final documentation is received and reflects the
agencys expectations the expected rating is converted to a final rating Expected ratings may
be used for index classification purposes to ensure bonds are added to indices in a timely
manner or to classify splitrated issuers properly
ExDividend Date
The first date on which the holder of a bond is not entitled to receive the next interest
payment Index users will see the accrued interest of a bond show as negative once it starts
trading exdividend and the expected coupon payment is discounted back to the current
index settlement date
Fiscal Strength Weighted
Alternative weighting methodology for Bloomberg Indices that tilts the natural market value
weight of bonds based on measures of sovereign and institutional strength such as debt as a
percentage of GDP deficit as a percentage of GDP and current account balance as a
percentage of GDP
Flash Index Report
Daily report published at about 430pm New York time that estimates preliminary index
returns for select US indices based on initial pricing Final index returns may differ from early

Float Adjusted
Within Bloomberg Indices adjustments made to the par amount outstanding of bonds for
holdings of central governments that are publicly available US nominal and inflationlinked
Treasuries held by the US government in SOMA accounts are adjusted in flagship Bloomberg
SeriesL indices Other SOMA holdings as well as Bank of England and Bank of Japan
holdings are not adjusted in flagship indices and are instead reflected in Float Adjusted
Indices
FloatingRate Note FRN
Bonds that accrue interest based on a specified spread over a reference rate that resets
periodically Floating rate corporate ABS and treasury indices are available within the index
platform
Forward Value
In the indices currency hedging methodology the number of basecurrency units to be
received for each unit of the local currency delivered in the forward contract This value is set
in the market place at the beginning of the month and is received at delivery at the end of the
month
FX SpotForward Rate FX spot and 1month forward exchange rates sourced from Refinitiv at 4pm London time for
purposes of currency return and market value calculations in Bloomberg Indices
GDP Weighted Alternative weighting methodology for Bloomberg Indices that weights bonds based on the
gross domestic product GDP of a bonds country of risk
Global Risk Model
Multifactor risk model available through the POINT and Bloomberg platforms that quantifies
risks exposures of portfolio instruments by identifying common sources of risk along different
dimensions systematic risk factors For fixedincome instruments systematic risk factors are
typically divided into two sets those that influence securities across asset classes eg yield

Appendix 7 Glossary of Terms  Index Analytics
Ask Spread Calculated as the Spread to Benchmark see below for definition minus 10bp
Average Life The parweighted average time in years to the principal repayment for noncallable securities
and the parweighted average time in years to the probable callput for callable securities
Blended Spread

1980s by struggling sovereign countries and partially collateralized by the US Treasury
excluding said collateralization
Convexity OAC
Convexity is the second derivative of the priceyield function and measures the secondorder
change in the price of a bond with respect to yield changes OAC is positive for conventional
bonds and is generally negative for mortgage passthroughs Negative convexity dampens the
price appreciation if interest rates fall and aggravates the price decline if interest rates rise
Constant Prepayment Rate CPR
For ABS MBS and CMBS bonds CPR measures prepayments as a percentage of the current
outstanding balance CPR can be realized or projected realized CPR is used in MBS
prepayment return calculations while projected CPR for MBS is generated by the mortgage
prepayment model and serves as the basis for index analytics such as duration It is expressed
as an annual rate eg a CPR of 10 indicates that 10 of a pools current loan balance is
projected to prepay over the next year
Current Yield Defined as the ratio of the annual income interest or dividends received by the bond divided
by the current price of the security
Duration Times Spread DTS
Duration Times Spread is usually calculated as LOAS  OASD This measure is popular for
spreadcredit risk analysis as the volatility of the spread return of a security is typically
proportional to its DTS DTS factors are used for a number of asset classes in the Hybrid
Performance Attribution Model and Global Risk Model
DV01
The dollar duration or DV01 is defined as the derivative of the security with respect to its yield
It can also be seen as the product of modified duration and the price of the financial
instrument
ISMA Duration
International Securities Market Association ISMA formerly AIBD duration is used in place of
OAD for nonUS securities The major difference between these two measures is the
assumption of an annual coupon instead of a semiannual coupon in ISMA yield calculations
ISMA Yield Represents a standard yield to maturity calculation recommended by ISMA The ISMA yield is
compounded annually regardless of the coupon frequency
Key Rate Duration KRD
A measure of the sensitivity of a security to a specified maturity range on the constant maturity
par yield curve The KRD maturities used are the 6m 2y 5y 7y for JPY 10y 20y and 30y The
sum of the KRDs will not necessarily equal the OAD the parallel shift OAD makes the
assumption that all points on the yield curve are perfectly correlated eg they move in
parallel where KRD calculations assume a linear correlation for nearly all maturities The shift
size is 25bp for corporate bonds and 5bp for government and securitized issues
Libor Option Adjusted Duration
LOAD
A measure of a securitys sensitivity to interest rates Bloomberg uses a lognormal option
model and the current price of the bond to calculate the Liboroption adjusted spread LOAS of the bond Keeping LOAS constant LOAD is calculated by shocking the par swap
curve as opposed to the par treasury curve for OAD up and down by a fixed amount and
measuring the resulting change in price The shift size for computing LOAD is 25bp for nongovernment securities and 10bp for government securities For swaps the size of the shift is
1bp
Libor Option Adjusted Spread LOAS
LOAS is the constant spread that when added to all discount rates from the swap curve on the
binomial interest rate tree model used by the indices will make the theoretical value of the
cash flows equal to the market price of the instrument
Macaulay Duration A measure of the weighted average time to maturity in years for an investor to receive the
present value cash flows from a bond
Maturity
The time in years for which an instrument remains outstanding The term refers to a finite
period at the end of which the instrument will no longer exist and the principal is repaid with
interest
Modified Duration A measure of the effect that a 100bp change in interest rates will have on the price of a bond
Mortgage Rate Duration
A measure of the price sensitivity to changes in the mortgage rate used in the term structure
model It can be thought of as the delta of the embedded prepayment option in an MBS
where the option strike is the current mortgage rate
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 100
Muni Duration
The duration of a taxexempt municipal bond It is calculated using the nonzero noncallable
AAA General Obligation GO Municipals curve instead of a standard treasurybased yield
curve
Muni Yield The yield for taxexempt municipal bonds It is yield to call if a bond is priced above its call
price and yield to maturity when it is priced below the call price
Nominal Duration
Calculated for inflationlinked securities as a betaadjusted duration Also referred to as
Empirical Duration Calculated for SeriesL US TIPS only The beta used is a 60day trailing
beta
Nominal Yield Represents the coupon rate on a bond The nominal yield is the interest rate to par value that
the bond issuer promises to pay the bond holders
Option Adjusted Duration OAD
A measure of a securitys sensitivity to interest rates The indices use a lognormal option model
and the current price of the bond to calculate the option adjusted spread OAS of the bond
Then keeping this OAS constant OAD is calculated by shocking the par yield curve as
opposed to the zero or forward curves up and down by a fixed amount and measuring the
resulting change in price The shift size for computing OAD is 25bp for nongovernment
securities and 10bp for government securities For swaps the size of the shift is 1bp
Option Adjusted Spread OAS
The constant spread that when added to all discount rates from the treasury curve on the
binomial interest rate tree model used by the indices will make the theoretical value of the
future cash flows equal to the market price of the instrument
Option Adjusted Spread Duration
OASD
A measure of a securitys price sensitivity to changes in the OAS The shift size for computing
the OASD is 25bp for nongovernment securities 10bp for government securities and 1bp for
interest rate derivatives
Par Curve Graph of the yields of hypothetical treasury bonds trading at par On the par curve the yield to
maturity of a security is equal to its coupon The par curve can be derived from the spot curve
Projected OAD Indexlevel OAD based on the Projected Universe of an index Each bond contributes based
on its current market value
Real Duration
Calculated for inflationlinked bonds as the sensitivity in real prices to changes in real yield
Real duration calculations mirror standard calculations for nominal duration but use real
instead of nominal yields
Returns OAD
Indexlevel OAD based on the Returns Universe of an index Each bond contributes based on
RU Security Market ValueRU Total Market Value which effectively scales returns OAD
downward for cash
Real Yield
Represents an interest rate that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation It reflects
the real cost of funds to the borrower and the real yield to the lender The real interest rate is
calculated as the difference between the nominal rate and inflation projections
Spline Curve
The treasury spot curve generated by a spline process These treasury curves are constructed
via the VasicekFong cubic exponential spline which is a fitted parametric discount function
that prices government zero coupon bonds at any maturity and models the discount factors as
a weighted sum of exponential functions The spline depends on parameters determined by
minimizing the quadratic error of the market price of a given set of coupon bonds and sums
their discounted cash flows
Spot Curve
A representation of the term structure of interest rates in the government bond markets These
swap curves are constructed via a bootstrap methodology The spot curve can be used as a
starting point to price any fixed income security and to derive the par or forward curves
Spread to Benchmark
The quoted spread of a bond that is relative to the security off which it is priced typically an
ontherun treasury the 2y US Treasury bellwether the 5y US Treasury bellwether etc For
MBS this represents a calculated value which is derived as the yield of the MBS generic minus
the yield of the US Treasury bellwether with the closest average life to the MBS generic
Vega
A measure of a securitys sensitivity to implied volatility The indices use a lognormal option
model and the current price of the bond to compute optionadjusted analytics The vega is
computed by bumping the implied volatility in the stochastic interest rate model by 1 while
keeping everything else constant
Yield to Maturity
Represents the rate of return anticipated on a bond if held until its maturity The YTM
calculation takes into account the bonds current market price par value coupon interest rate
and time to maturity under the assumptions that all cash flows received are reinvested at the
same rate as the bonds current yield
Yield to Worst Represents the lowest potential yield that an investor would receive on a bond if the issuer
does not default The yield to worst is calculated by making worstcase scenario assumptions
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 101
on the issue by calculating the returns that would be received if provisions including
prepayment call or sinking fund are used by the issuer The YTW is used to evaluate the
worstcase scenario for yield to help investors manage their risk and exposures
ZV Spread
The zerovolatility spread represents the spread that the investor would realize over the entire
treasury spot rate if the bond is held to maturity It is the spread that makes the present value
of the cash flows from corporate bond when discounted at the treasury spot rate plus the
spread equal to the corporate bonds price
Appendix 8 Glossary of Terms  Index Aggregation Values
Amount Outstanding
Par amount outstanding of a bond expressed in the index base reporting currency Amount
Outstanding for an indexeligible security is adjusted for full or partial calls sink events and
agency MBS prepayments Float adjustments are also made to Amount Outstanding values in
Bloomberg flagship indices for nominal and inflationlinked US Treasuries It reflects the
current amount outstanding of a bond in the Projected Universe changes to amount
outstanding are reflected in a bonds contribution to indexlevel returns in the month following
the adjustment
Amount Outstanding BOM
This reflects the par amount outstanding of a bond at the beginning of the month and is held
constant during the month within a given index This is the outstanding value that determines a
bonds contribution to indexlevel returns along with beginning of the month price and
accrued interest
Amount Outstanding Global
Aggregate
For each indexeligible security Amount Outstanding Global Aggregate is calculated as a
scaled unit that is used to determine Global Aggregate Index eligibility The fixed minimum
issue size for each local currency bond market is set to 300mn Amount Outstanding Global
Aggregate units establishing the ratio for calculation of this value for all bonds denominated
in a given local currency For example a JPYdenominated bond with 35bn par amount
outstanding which is equal to the Global Aggregate minimum for JPY would show an Amount
Outstanding Global Aggregate value of 300mn while a JPYdenominated bond with a 70bn
par amount outstanding would show an Amount Outstanding Global Aggregate value of
600mn
Amount Outstanding Native
Par amount outstanding of a bond expressed in the currency denomination of the bond
Amount Outstanding Native can be equal to the Amount Outstanding depending on
whether the bond is denominated in the index base reporting currency For example a GBPdenominated bond would have Amount Outstanding expressed in EUR to reflect the base
reporting currency of the PanEuropean Aggregate Index but Amount Outstanding Native
would be expressed in GBP A EURdenominated bond would have both Amount Outstanding
and Amount Outstanding Native expressed in EUR
Capped Market Value
An instruments market value adjusted to reflect bondlevel weights within a constrained
composite or other alternative weight index Within a given alternative weight index the value
that is displayed in the Market Value field will reflect the specific weighting scheme of the
benchmark Capped Market Value is not an explicit attribute that is available to index users
Market Value
This reflects the current price accrued interest and amount outstanding of a bond and is used
in the aggregation of indexlevel statistics such as duration and yield It is calculated as
Ending Price  Accrued Interest  Amount Outstanding100 Index users looking at the
Market Value field within the context of index that is constructed using an alternative weighting
scheme will see a value that reflects the specified capping composite weights etc
Market Value BOM
This reflects the market value of a bond at the beginning of the month and is held constant
during the month for index purposes This is the value that determines a bonds contribution
to indexlevel returns and is a function of the beginning of the month amount outstanding
price and accrued interest
RU Cash Market Value Defined as RU Market Value  RU Security Market Value RU Cash Market Value is used in the
calculation of returns OAD which is scaled downward for cash held in the index
RU Market Value
Calculated as Price BOM  Accrued BOM  Outstanding BOM  1 Total Return RU Market

Appendix 9 Index Governance and Index Methodology Considerations
Benchmark Governance Audit and Review Structure
BISL uses two primary committees to provide overall governance and effective oversight of its
benchmark administration activities
 The Product Risk  Operations Committee PROC provides direct governance and is
responsible for the first line of controls over the creation design production and
dissemination of benchmark indices strategy indices and fixings administered by BISL
including the Indices The PROC is composed of Bloomberg personnel with significant
experience or relevant expertise in relation to financial benchmarks Meetings are attended
by Bloomberg Legal  Compliance personnel Nominations and removals are subject to
review by the BOC discussed below
 The oversight function is provided by Bloombergs Benchmark Oversight Committee
BOC The BOC is independent of the PROC and is responsible for reviewing and
challenging the activities carried out by the PROC In carrying out its oversight duties the
BOC receives reports of management information both from the PROC as well as Bloomberg
Legal  Compliance members engaged in second level controls
On a quarterly basis the PROC reports to the BOC on governance matters including but not
limited to client complaints the launch of new benchmarks operational incidents including
errors  restatements major announcements and material changes concerning the
benchmarks the results of any reviews of the benchmarks internal or external and material
stakeholder engagements
Internal and External Reviews
BISLs index administration is also subject to Bloombergs Compliance function which
periodically reviews various aspects of its businesses in order to determine whether it is
adhering to applicable policies and procedures and assess whether applicable controls are
functioning properly In addition Bloomberg may from time to time appoint an independent
external auditor with appropriate experience and capability to review adherence to benchmark
regulation The frequency of such external reviews will depend on the size and complexity of the
operations and the breadth and depth of the Index use by stakeholders
Index Advisory Council IAC
IACs are composed of key market participants and other influential individuals to assist BISL in
setting index priorities to discuss potential rules changes and to provide ideas for new
products IACs are generally constituted on an annual basis While potential benchmark
changes are discussed through this process all feedback received is nonbinding and all final
decisions on benchmark index rules are made by the PROC subject to BOC review after the
review period has ended
Data Providers and Data Extrapolation
Bloomberg indices are rulesbased and their construction is designed to consistently produce
index levels without the exercise of discretion Except as otherwise described in this
methodology document the indices are produced without the interpolation or extrapolation of
input data
In addition BISL seeks to avoid contributions of input data that may be subject to the discretion
of the source of such data and instead seeks to use input data that is readily available andor
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 103
distributed for a number of nonindex or benchmarkcreation purposes Accordingly the indices
require no contributors to produce and no codes of conduct with any such sources are
required
Index and Data Reviews
BISL will review the indices both the rules of construction and data inputs on a periodic basis
not less frequently than annually to determine whether they continue to reasonably measure
the intended underlying market interest the economic reality or otherwise align with their stated
objective More frequent reviews may result from extreme market events andor material
changes to the applicable underlying market interests
Criteria for data inputs include reliable delivery and active underlying markets Whether an
applicable market is active depends on whether there are sufficient numbers of transactions or
other indications of price such as indicative quotes in the applicable constituents or similar
underlying constituent elements that a price or other value as applicable may be supplied for
such constituents
Other than as set forth in this methodology there are no minimum liquidity requirements for
index constituents andor minimum requirements or standards for the quantity or quality of the
input data However there are often amount outstanding minimums which function as a proxy
for liquidity
The review will be conducted by product managers of the indices in connection with the
periodic rebalancing of the indices or as otherwise appropriate
Any resulting change to this methodology deemed to be material discussed below will be
subject to the review of the PROC under the oversight of the BOC each of which committees
shall be provided all relevant information and materials it requests relating to the change
Details regarding the PROC and BOC are described above
Material changes will be reflected and tracked in updated versions of this methodology
BISLs index administration is also subject to Bloombergs Compliance function which
periodically reviews various aspects of its businesses in order to determine whether it is
adhering to applicable policies and procedures and assess whether applicable controls are
functioning properly
Material changes related to the Bloomberg indices will be made available in advance to affected
stakeholders whose input will be solicited The stakeholder engagement will set forth the
rationale for any proposed changes as well as the timeframe and process for responses BISL will
endeavour to provide at least two weeks for review prior to any material change going into
effect In the event of exigent market circumstances this period may be shorter Subject to
requests for confidentiality stakeholder feedback and BISLs responses will be made accessible
upon request
In determining whether a change to the Indices is material the following factors shall be taken
into account
 The economic financial andor operational impact of the change
 Whether the change affects the original purpose of the Index andor
 Whether the change is consistent with the overall objective of the Index and the underlying
market interest it seeks to measure
Restatement Policy
Bloomberg makes every effort to provide accurate calculation of its indices However to the
extent a material error in index level is uncovered following its publication and dissemination a
notification will be sent to index clients alerting them of such error and the expected date of a
revised publication if warranted Bloomberg considers the following factors to determine
whether to restate Not all conditions need to be present to warrant a restatement and certain
Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices August 24 2021
Bloomberg Fixed Income Index Methodology 104
factors may be more determinative that others depending on the circumstances of the given
error
A The relative importance of the data field impacted by the error
B When the error occurred and when it was discovered
C The number of indices and subindices affected
D Whether the impacted indices are linked to tradable products
E The magnitude of the error
F The burden of restatement on client reprocessing relative to the impact of the error
G The impact of the restatement on analytical tools
General Methodology Considerations
Limitations of the Indices
Though the indices are designed to be representative of the markets they measure or otherwise
align with their stated objective they may not be representative in every case or achieve their
stated objective in all instances They are designed and calculated strictly to follow the rules of
this methodology and any index level or other output is limited in its usefulness to such design
and calculation
Markets can be volatile including those market interests which the indices intend to measure or
upon which the indices are dependent in order to achieve their stated objective For example
illiquidity can have an impact on the quality or amount of data available to BISL for calculation
and may cause the Indices to produce unpredictable or unanticipated results
In addition market trends and changes to market structure may render the objective of the
indices unachievable or to become impractical to replicate by investors
In particular the indices measure global fixed income markets As with all fixed income
investing the indices are exposed to interest rate risk The value of bonds fluctuates with the
changes in the interest rate policies established by central banks and the natural movement of
rates over time Bonds with optionality will also be impacted by interest rate volatilities Most
fixed income securities often trade at a spread to the base interest rate curve The level of the
spread reflects the additional premium an investor requires for taking the additional credit risk
liquidity risk and other risks The change of the spread which reflects primarily the change in
perceived risk of a security comes from both common forces affecting all bonds with similar
characteristics and information specific to a particular issuer As the indices are designed to
measure those markets its indices could be materially impacted by market movements thus
significantly impacting the use or usefulness of the fixings for some or all users
In addition certain subindices may be designed to measure smaller subsets of the indices such
as specific sectors maturities or credit quality bands Some of these subindices have very few
qualifying constituents and may have none for a period of time During such period the
subindex will continue to be published at its last value effectively reporting a 0 return until
new constituents qualify If no constituents are expected to qualify due to changes in issuance
trends and other factors the subindex may be discontinued In such an event this
discontinuation will be announced to index users

In the event it does determine to use third parties in the performance of such roles BISL will
provide details of their function in this methodology and establish appropriate controls in its
internal procedures
Expert Judgment
BISL may use expert judgment with regards to the following
 Index restatements
 Extraordinary circumstances during a market emergency

Appendix Information
The Bloomberg SASB ESG Equity and Fixed Income indices are designed to be socially responsible investment benchmarks
derived from the Bloomberg size and style equity indices and the Bloomberg fixed income indices
The policy benchmarks in the Bloomberg SASB ESG family use a tilting methodology to reallocate equityissuer weights based on
an ESG metric called RFactor which is designed to measure the performance of a companys business operations and governance
as it relates to financially material ESG challenges facing the companys industry
The Select index variants are optimized to maximize exposure to the ESG score while maintaining similar riskreturn
characteristics to the base indices
Responsible investing requires a tool to measure the performance of a companys business operations and governance as it relates
to financially material ESG challenges facing the companys industry State Street Global Advisors RFactor TM is designed to be
this mechanism The score draws on data from multiple providers and leverages widely accepted transparent materiality
frameworks to generate a unique ESG score for listed companies It was designed to offer companies and investors greater
transparency about which financially material ESG issues drive a companys score  and ultimately to help build more sustainable
capital markets At the core of RFactorTM score is a mapping algorithm that uses metrics that are financially material across 77
industries and 17 regulatory regimes The methodology was designed around a transparent analytical framework and the standards
of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB
